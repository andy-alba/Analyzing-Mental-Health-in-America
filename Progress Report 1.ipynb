    "Over the course of a few years, mental health topics in the United States have become less taboo, and many are beginning to engage in an open and inviting conversation on their own psychological state. However, there has been a well documented increase of mental illness, specifically depression, across the United States. In order to shed light on the potential causes of this trend, we aim to explore the effect of different factors on the mental health status of the American population using survey data. Given the overwhelming impact of technology in today’s society and the increasing use of social media  as a source of community, we hope to investigate the scope of information available and topics covered in mental health online forums as compared to survey data.

    "We utilized data from the National Health Interview Survey, an annual cross-sectional survey by the National Center for Health Statistics that aims to illustrate the the health status of those living in the United States. This survey includes a wide range of factors, covering information from health insurance to annual income. There is data for every year between 2004 to 2017, and they are split into multiple files. We began by only looking at the “Person” file from the most recent data in 2017 because it contained a clear indicator of whether a subject had depression. The original CSV contained 700 features, but after going through the features individually in the data documentation, we selected 46 possible features of interest. These features are listed below: \n"

    "We initially believed that the “Person” file also included the physical weights of each individual, however, upon further inspection, we discovered that key physical characteristics such as weight and height were in the “Sample Adult” and “Sample Child” files. According to the data documentation, these values have been modified to protect the privacy of the individuals surveyed. Height was limited to 59-70 inches for women and 63-76 inches for men. Similarly, weight was limited to 100-274 pounds for women and 126-299 pounds for men. BMI was calculated even for persons whose data was altered, so we made note of that as well. Although we could have applied to obtain some of the confidential data, due to monetary concerns, we did not pursue this further."

We can see that the majority of people who are depressed have been depressed for more than 1 year with very few people identifying as being depressed for less than a year. This may be explained by depression being something that occurs over a long period of time rather than a few days. In addition, we can see that a majority of people who are depressed have a salary of less than $5000. This tells us that money may possibly play a large role in a persons depression or vice versa. "
