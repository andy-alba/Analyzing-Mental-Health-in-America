    "Over the course of a few years, mental health topics in the United States have become less taboo, and many are beginning to engage in an open and inviting conversation on their own psychological state. However, there has been a well documented increase of mental illness, specifically depression, across the United States. In order to shed light on the potential causes of this trend, we aim to explore the effect of different factors on the mental health status of the American population using survey data. Given the overwhelming impact of technology in today’s society and the increasing use of social media  as a source of community, we hope to investigate the scope of information available and topics covered in mental health online forums as compared to survey data.

    "We utilized data from the National Health Interview Survey, an annual cross-sectional survey by the National Center for Health Statistics that aims to illustrate the the health status of those living in the United States. This survey includes a wide range of factors, covering information from health insurance to annual income. There is data for every year between 2004 to 2017, and they are split into multiple files. We began by only looking at the “Person” file from the most recent data in 2017 because it contained a clear indicator of whether a subject had depression. The original CSV contained 700 features, but after going through the features individually in the data documentation, we selected 46 possible features of interest.

According to the data documentation, these values have been modified to protect the privacy of the individuals surveyed. Height was limited to 59-70 inches for women and 63-76 inches for men. Similarly, weight was limited to 100-274 pounds for women and 126-299 pounds for men. BMI was calculated even for persons whose data was altered, so we made note of that as well.

    "Although we contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about obtaining the data from 2004 to 2005, we have not received a response and thus will only look at data from 2006 to 2017 for the rest of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "For data cleaning, the first goal was to merge the \"Family\" files into the \"Person\" files and \"Sample Adult\" files for each year so that we have family and individual characteristics for each observation. We decided to disregard the \"Sample Child\" files, to limit the number of variables and for easier comparison. The first issue we ran into when cleaning the data was the way the data was stored. The data from 2006 to 2014 were all in ASCII format, which Python struggled to read due to rows having different lengths. To deal with this, we attempted to use the SAS formating files that the NHIS provided with the datasets. The SAS code converted each ASCII file to a SAS dataset, and so we ran a SAS file for each dataset we had. We then merged the appropriate datasets for each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "New issues arose when we tried exporting the SAS datasets as CSVs. The SAS files converted the categorical variables that were stored as integers into meaningful phrases. These phrases, however, could be long. For example, the categories for the variable corresponding to \"region\" are as follows:  \n",
    "* Northeast\n",
    "* Midwest\n",
    "* South\n",
    "* West  \n",
    "\n",
    "While these levels don't seem that long, there were too many variables in each dataset. In 2014 alone, there were 1,539 variables. Some factors had much more complicated levels, and so SAS began to truncate columns when it was exporting the data as CSVs. We attempted to export the data without the detailed factors in SAS, but the sheer number of variables exceeded the logical record length in SAS. SAS truncated the variable names, so instead of having the real variable name, we would get var_899. Initially, we wanted to keep as many variables as possible, but as a result of the truncations, we had to select a subset of the variables. Ultimately, we choose 331, which later dropped to 285 common variables among all years.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all the data was exported as CSVs, we used Python to merge all the separate files into one master data frame with 285 variables and 1,109,807 observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we plotted the data for one year, we wanted to do the same for each year in the survey data. After cleaning the data, we used an interactive plot to show the distribution of each year's reported depression length by income level."

    "The plot shows that as time goes on, there were more reports of depression at each income level. This could suggest that more people are becoming okay with sharing the information about themselves as the stigma against mental disorders lessens.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was also noted that each year had about 75,000 to 110,000 observations. However, most of these observations did not have a reported depression length, possibly from the person not knowing if they were depressed, not wanting to report it or just leaving the question empty. About 95% of the observations did not have a value for length of depression. This plot showcased the 5% that reported a depression length. The number of observations each year increased up until 2014. That year, the number of observations peaked, and the number of observations declined after.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general distributions for each year were similar to each other. Each year, the lowest income level had the highest counts of reported depression. The $65,000 to $75,000 income level had the least reported depression length. The general trend between income level and depression was the lower the income level, the more the counts of reported depression and the higher the income level, the less the counts of reported depression. \n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of the counts for most of the income levels in each year had more than one year of depression. As each year passes, it is possible that the reported depression favors the more than one year of depression option. If the people from the previous year were still depressed, they would be in the more than one year option for the next years. Also, it is possible that it takes a year for someone to be diagnosed as having a depression disorder as opposed to simply feeling depressed in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to investigate the relationship between specific features and the depression variable, we utilized PCA to try to detect a cluster structure. Initially, running PCA and graphing the components did not help in our visualization of individual clusters. This is likely due to the fact that our variables are categorical and other measures need to be taken. In the upcoming weeks, we plan on utilizing multiple correspondence analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The features used in the PCA were sex, race/ethnicity, age, parent(s) present in the family , duration of weight problem (in years), weight problem condition status, and duration of alcohol/drug/substance abuse problem. As shown in the graph, there seems to be a little bit of cluster structure with the data that is associated with non-chronic depression. However, these differences will likely be more evident with other techniques. "
