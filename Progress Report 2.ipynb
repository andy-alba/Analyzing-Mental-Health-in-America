    "Over the course of a few years, mental health topics in the United States have become less taboo, and many are beginning to engage in an open and inviting conversation on their own psychological state. However, there has been a well documented increase of mental illness, specifically depression, across the United States. In order to shed light on the potential causes of this trend, we aim to explore the effect of different factors on the mental health status of the American population using survey data. Given the overwhelming impact of technology in today’s society and the increasing use of social media  as a source of community, we hope to investigate the scope of information available and topics covered in mental health online forums as compared to survey data.

    "We utilized data from the National Health Interview Survey, an annual cross-sectional survey by the National Center for Health Statistics that aims to illustrate the the health status of those living in the United States. This survey includes a wide range of factors, covering information from health insurance to annual income. There is data for every year between 2004 to 2017, and they are split into multiple files. We began by only looking at the “Person” file from the most recent data in 2017 because it contained a clear indicator of whether a subject had depression. The original CSV contained 700 features, but after going through the features individually in the data documentation, we selected 46 possible features of interest.

According to the data documentation, these values have been modified to protect the privacy of the individuals surveyed. Height was limited to 59-70 inches for women and 63-76 inches for men. Similarly, weight was limited to 100-274 pounds for women and 126-299 pounds for men. BMI was calculated even for persons whose data was altered, so we made note of that as well.

About 95% of the observations did not have a value for length of depression. This plot showcased the 5% that reported a depression length.

In the upcoming weeks we plan on utilizing multiple correspondence analysis which is virtually PCA for categorical variables. \n",

Some of these discussions had over 5000 comments on them, however the reddit website only allows us to see 500 comments at a time.

When grabbing these replies, a lot of the meaning behind what the reply means is lost since we do not know what comment they are replying to and keeping track of all the threads can get problematic.\n"
