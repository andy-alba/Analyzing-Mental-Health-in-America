0,I’m so fucking lonely.,"I feel like I never shut up about feeling this way but I’m having an exceptionally hard night. Didn’t leave the house all day and sulked in bed watching YouTube for hours. I feel like I’m wasting away and like my existence doesn’t matter. My friends don’t text me back or stick with our plans and I have nobody who willingly reaches out to me that’s close by. 

My girlfriend is always busy at university with her friends and has a difficult time getting back to me because she’s surrounded by people and her schoolwork. I feel so disconnected from her and her life and I just feel like an outsider to my own life. 

Having really bad thoughts tonight, I just want a change of life.",267,bhv1vw,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bhv1vw/im_so_fucking_lonely/,2019-04-27

3,I WANT TO FEEL GOOD,"I want a natural happiness. But it doesn’t come naturally. It can only be manufactured for a few hours, and then leeched away by my cells dividing and purging.

I want to be sad when I should feel sad, and happy when I should feel happy. I want organic, raw emotion to rip through me like I remember. I want to flee from this constant gray monotony and be free again.",21,bhv9od,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bhv9od/i_want_to_feel_good/,2019-04-27
4,Fantasizing about dying. Not killing myself but something horrible happening to me?,"I often daydream about getting  hit by a car and bleeding out or getting shot. I think about how I could just fall sleep and just drift away. I’m too scared to hurt myself or kill myself but I always imagine myself dying or getting hurt. Lately I’ve been doing it more. While driving I think about a car crashing into me. I don’t wish to hurt others or even traumatizing the people around me should something horrible happen, but I constantly think about it now. I feel worthless and the thought of dying feels like such a pleasure and relief it makes me feel better just thinking about it, but it scares me just as much.",79,bhvbaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bhvbaw/fantasizing_about_dying_not_killing_myself_but/,2019-04-27
5,im 13. and i haven't felt alive for awhile.,"hi, my name's hannah. in the title i had mentioned im thirteen; specifically, seventh grade; this is true. im from maryland, too, if that helps. this might be poorly written and all over the place, for this i am sorry. first post ever &amp; on mobile.

ive been feeling aggressively really sad lately. maybe the past year and a half, and i have already gotten a habit to [ tw; self harm. ] cutting myself when i was this sad. right now, it's been four months since i last tried to cut myself. 

at school, im seen as this introverted girl who get all A's in her classes. some find me weird because of my quietness, some find me weird because i wear band shirts and black jeans. sometimes, ill get picked on because of my acne. but, im used to that.

anyways, ive been crying for the past hour because i feel like such a useless, worthless, piece of garbage of a human being who only sleeps to find joy. when im awake, i feel pain. mentally. i sleep this pain off, usually all day. i have no reason to be this sad for no reason. i have wanted to self destruct and, give up a lot. but, i never have. honestly, i think i should be happy because i have a generally good life. i have a home. i have food on the table. and i have bed and clothes. i am very grateful for my mom and my step dad for providing our house. i live with two older brothers and one younger. that's fine. i also switch between houses once a weekend to go to my dads. i have internet friends i very much love. 

but. i feel like absolute shit. all the time. i don't know how to describe this pain other than being numb. i am very numb inside. i feel very little emotions that are not being slightly happy and sadness. these more negative emotions are extra extreme when i am about to get my period/ when i do have it. before when i was almost twelve, i had never felt this way before. &amp; these negative emotions are even worse during the winter. sometimes my life feels like: sleep, eat, school. i don't study for tests and i get very small amounts of homework. yet school is just so hard for me now, because i am not motivated enough to get out of bed. to not do my work but, i have to.

other than my older sisters ( one in college, one in the air force ), are really stupid to me. my second youngest brother did ninth grade three times and dropped out. my oldest brother, dropped out and now smokes weed a bunch although, he has a job at walmart and i am very proud of him for this. respectively, my brothers, in the order i explained their situation in, are nineteen and almost twenty.
i do not want to end up like them, addicted to weed and drop out. i don't know what i would do to myself if i ever did.

im only barely thirteen, and i have contemplated commiting suicide. i feel like i have no reason to live, that there is no joy in my life to keep me going. but, i can not commit suicide, especially so young, because the thought of making my mom, dad, and step dad sad makes me even sadder than i already am. my name is hannah, im thirteen, from maryland and im here to ask you guys if you think i am depressed or just faking it or something. i don't know what to do with my self anymore. 

ALSO : i am too afraid to tell anyone in my life that i feel like this, especially my mom. i just love her so much and i would hate for her to know ive been feeling like this for a year or so.  a few people at school know i feel like this, but they usually just joke around about it. it makes me uncomfortable, but that is okay. i trust them, because they're my only friends at school.",96,bhvk2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bhvk2j/im_13_and_i_havent_felt_alive_for_awhile/,2019-04-27
6,Music is the only thing stopping me from killing myself,"I have no friends, nobody at all that I talk to besides one person who I'm in a toxic relationship with. The one person who I thought I could rely on and who I thought supported me has turned out to be a hateful bitch. I can't find work anywhere because I have no school qualifications or previous experience, and it's an endless source of bullying from this aforementioned individual (who I also live with, by the way). Literally the only three people I can rely on and that I like talking to are my dad, my grandmother, and my grandfather.

I stopped seeing my psychologist about a month ago because she was extremely unhelpful and didn't seem to 'get' my situation at all (eg. she laughed off the fact I had started taking speed again, and didn't seem to understand the severity of my sleeping problems, where I have been only getting a few hours of sleep per night and have constant nightmares/hypnopompic hallucinations to which her helpful solution was to 'listen to chinese gongs before sleep'). Stupid me for seeing a cheapo psychologist who is subsidised by healthcare and thus free, I guess, but I could never afford to see one on my own income. I also stopped taking the medication I was on because I thought it might be causing my sleeping troubles, but all that's done is bring back my sex drive, appetite, social anxiety, and depression, so now I pretty much never leave the house.

Throughout all this, literally the only reason I get up in the morning is to listen to music, and read books about music. I sort of went off my music obsession over the past few years, but ever since these past few months it has resurfaced in a massive way. The excitement of finding new artists and albums is the only thing that keeps me going, but I am really worried what's going to happen when that joy expires",30,bhvl1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bhvl1q/music_is_the_only_thing_stopping_me_from_killing/,2019-04-27
7,Solace,"I’ve been losing part of me lately. I don’t even know if this is the right fucking sub to post in. I’m a recovering meth/speed addict. 648 days off of it. My whole last year has consisted off bouncing out of the deep depression I felt when I was getting off drugs. I built up this fake it till you make it mentality, crushing it as I call it. And it grew on me, and I began to believe in it and build myself up again. 

Lately I feel that slipping away, I feel these dark thoughts coming in my head. I haven’t had a craving to get lit in months but I’ve been feeling it lately. I go to NA, I got a support system. I’ve just been losing this thing I found that I’ve held on to in trying to find myself again. I’m not sleeping well, I keep puking. 

And I keep telling myself I’m doing great but I’m having trouble shaking these doubts off, and I don’t like my face when I look in the mirror. I don’t know if I’m angry or disgusted. My teeth are fake. And half of me is fixing to tell me give up, but the other half is motivated, I think. And I don’t want my grip to slip. I just needed somewhere to get that off my chest.",57,bhvvg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bhvvg5/solace/,2019-04-27

9,"No interests or hobbies, no ambition or drive, no one I have genuinely cared for or loved (family included) and a constant voice telling me I'm stuck in a village of idiots with no way out of its trap.","So I live in ,what is nowadays, a large village. Countryside, farms and hills in every direction but due to its location between two large towns that have been established for centuries and were quite big players during the industrial revolution, making the village I live in a crossroads between the two aswell as neighbouring villages and local farmers. Due to this the village became a place for the workers to stop after work or on travels, long story short, we jump to 1998 when i was born and the village has 2 stereotypically British pubs, 2 cocktail bars and a night club. Jump again to 2019 and now its 6 stereotyically british pubs, 3 cocktail bars, 2 wine shops and 2 night clubs. Bare in mind all of these are in the same approximately 250 meters squared. The amount of booze and drugs that are consumed per week, on average and accounting for population, in this village is higher than anywhere in Britain. We have a higher case of mental illness than anywhere else in Britain. We have one of the highest drug and alcohol related deaths in Britain. 

I am the youngest of 5 in my family. So theres (gonna use random names just to be safe):
Jacob - 33 
Jenny - 30
Jonathan - 28
James - 27
Junior (Me) - 21
My family was living in this village before I was born so I've lived here my entire life. Due to us living in a village, every family knew each other and thrpugh the years before i was born and while i was young, my siblings had made a name for themselves. We were the ones who were known for being straight to the point, forward and would never beat around the bush or hide what we felt. We were known for holding house parties that were regarded the best by far and became almost a village tradition to be at our Christmas and new years party (I know it sounds so vain and stuck up but I don't think the parties being great has anything to do with us, the house is just built in a way that makes it perfect for parties). So I grew up watching my siblings, one by one, go through the house parties and drugs and girls (sisters a lesbian), I grew up with those family friends that are basically part of the family, the ones your siblings went to school with and you can't imagine them ever not being at least regarded as a close acquaintance, but in this village that meant they were getting pissed up in fields at 14, smoking weed and fags at 16 and taking coke and pills by 17. At one point, there would be like 8/9 people in that main friend group that would come round for pre drinks at like 5pm, maybe 3/4 times a week, get pissed for cheap at home then just go out and drink stupid amounts, smoke some spliffs, sniff a load of coke and take a couple pills. I watched this happen to all 4 of them and even from a young age, I was aware that there were drugs involved. I knew about drugs and I knew enough of the most basic stuff (they're addictive, people are weird on them, they can cost a lot, a lot of the time they're used when in groups etc.). Living in a village, entertainment was limited so people watching and eavesdropping were my main way to stop myself feeling bored, from this I learnt all about my families use of drugs, their secrets, what they were planning and so on. So I formed an opinion of drugs like cocaine and weed at a young age; ""Some are very bad and are never to be touched, some can be fun but can't be used to much, some can be used as medicine and for fun when not abused"" 
I smoked my first cigarette at primary school in year 6, I was 11 (I think). I had my first joint when I was 13 at a house party a friend had thrown for his birthday (just to point out how bad this village is, he was turning 14 and his mum and dad let him throw a 50+ person house party, with booze, for his 13/14 year old friends). I had my first line of cocaine at 14 from one of those family friends I mentioned. I had my first ecstacy pill at 15 on my high school leavers party night. Since then I've tried shrooms, LSD, Acid, Ket, Speed and MD. I have never, for as long as I can remember, cared for anyone around me. I see use and potential use in people and that's all. I will and have fucked over, stolen from, got into physical fights with, back stabbed, abandoned and emotionally abused family, friends and strangers. It's not that I'm selfish, to be selfish I'd have to care about myself but I just don't have any feelings for anything. Family, friends, myself,  life...any genre, topic, subject or hobby... I have no drive for anything at all and even before the drugs I felt this way. In all social groups I'm connected too, I just play a fake me that was made specifically for that group. I play a character of me every single day in front of every single person, switching the mask each time I am in proximity to a person from a different group. It's not as easy as just taking off the mask and just being me... I am far from sane and the things that I'd say without my own filter would 100% leave me without a job, a family, any friends and genuinely I believe that I would be put in an asylum. While that makes it seem like I care about people or my own life/well being, the only reason i dont want that to happen is because these people all have uses and things to exploit to be able to just get fucked up and forget everything. Literally everything I want in life is to just get fucked up till I die... everything else is pointless. Every single day I something that makes me think just how stupid people are, how just eratic and illogical everyone is. Yet for some reason we just sit here and pretend as if everything is fine while the fucking morons and dipshits of the world somehow get ridiculous amounts of power and control everything.

13,Was recently diagnosed with manic depression aka bipolar disorder,"Huge weight off my chest, actually. My close friends asked me if it was scary to hear, but I was like not really. I've been living with it since I was ten, it's not like knowing it has a name is going to make it worse. In fact it's a comfort to know that it's not just a personality flaw. 

For a long time I thought being depressed was just a part of my personality. I thought growing up, you just stop caring about everything you ever loved. 

And I thought the manic highs and lows were character flaws, like I need to sleep more, why can't I sleep, or I'm sleeping too much, I'm a lazy shit. 

So knowing what I know now, I wish I had sought help sooner. 

I won't say I'm feeling better in general, I still regularly wish I were dead or just not here, but it's almost like hope's knocking out there somewhere. Like I'm not quite as alone as I used to feel, other people have this, it has a name. 

And I know now that that is not who I am, or who I'm supposed to be, and it does indeed feel like an actual illness and not just something that's my fault.",31,bhwwkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bhwwkg/was_recently_diagnosed_with_manic_depression_aka/,2019-04-27

Always picturing myself as a worry free, young and happy person enjoying it with someone I truly love. However, being stuck in my head reaching for unrealistic goals knowing l'll always be anxious or suffering from bad mental health, and the crippling limits I put on myself will always prevent me from living the life I so desperately wish I could live.   

And I might just not be good enough for anyone, the fear of being alone forever, which really brings me down.

15,Now I get it,"Now I get it.

I had that beam of sunlight break through the gray and dreary clouds that are usually overhead. It was really nice. My depression broke for a day or two (really, about a day and a half or so). I don’t know how. I don’t know why. I felt light on my feet and energetic and I was able to get things done.  I wasn’t paralyzed or weighed down. I just was. I just was what could have been.

It wasn’t a manic state. I’m not bipolar. It was just a positive state. I didn’t have The Black Dog nipping at my heels. I suddenly wasn’t carrying around this anvil of self-doubt and self-punishment.

And then I slipped. Clouds drew over my emotional landscape and I was back, right where I was. I became negative and quick to anger again. I struggled and stumbled.

Why take that away from me, I thought. It was a giant tease. I was not happy.

Then I realized: that was the universe (or my psyche) doing me an enormous favor. I got a brief glimpse of what could be. I got a great gift. I now have a very clear picture of what could be.

17,"Whenever I have a crush on someone, it feels like I'm falling in love with a fictional character.","I know I don't make any sense but the idea of me being with them is too good to be true like it's only something that happens in my dream. I always have a crush on people who are way out of my league, it feels they and I live in two different worlds and there's no way I can be a part of their world. It hurts so bad to fall in love with someone knowing that I don't stand a chance. And it hurts even more to force myself to get over it and stop thinking about it. 

So now whenever I have just a tiny little crush on someone, it puts me in a state of depression. I still daydream about going out with them one day and all kinds of fantasies people have when they're in love and it makes me feel so lonely because I know that I can only happen in my head and maybe I'm not going to find someone who truly wants me back.",36,bi1st7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bi1st7/whenever_i_have_a_crush_on_someone_it_feels_like/,2019-04-27

22,"I Don’t Want To Die, But I Wish More Than Anything That I Wasn’t Alive.","To clarify and give some context I’m 21M and have been struggling with thoughts and actions of taking my own life since I was 12. Things have gotten better in the past few years but that’s only due to me realizing what me committing suicide would do to my family. I know that they would be devastated and I care so much about them, enough that I’d never want to do something like that to them. However I have nothing in my life, family included that makes me happy enough to want to get out of bed in the morning. I fully believe that my future doesn’t hold anything else besides years more of this and I don’t want to experience it. So now I find myself torn between not wanting to live the life I have, and not wanting to hurt the people who would be affected by my ending it. This feeling came back with a vengeance because I met someone about a year ago whom I fell for because she finally made me happy and actually want to get up in the morning and made me look forward to the future and I thought this would finally be where all the shit I’ve gone through becomes worth it and I can have a future I actually want to be around for, but now I realize I have no future with her, which leaves back where I was before, with even more assuredness that this is where I’ll be for the rest of my life, and I fucking hate it.

TLDR: I have nothing going for me in my life and the only reason I don’t end it all is because I know how it’d hurt people I care about, even if they don’t make me happy enough to live my life.

27,Why does everyone care so much about how guys express their emotions?,"(I'm not trying to say men are systematically oppressed or anything because I know that's obviously not true, I'm just talking about one very specific problem I've encountered as a result of being and identifying as male.) 



If I'm literally struggling to feel like I have to reason to be alive why do I need rules for how I can express that? If I wanna cry and listen to Taylor Swift, (*Red* has some of my favorite music to listen to when I'm really upset. Sue me) and that makes me slightly less miserable, anyone should be happy. My parents and sister mostly understand but any other relatives I have including my sisters fiance who I see almost daily think it's so weird that I'm depressed and make that known and try to seek treatment for it. They think men need to deal with it themselves and stay stoic, or if they don't they must be gay. Even my now-ex girlfriend said a few times that I had a ""feminine side"" because she was one of the few people I'd cry or really express myself around. What does that even mean a ""feminine side?"" Being depressed is feminine?



Also it's impossible to talk about any of this with my guy friends, ever. I have a friend that I've literally been friends with for 16 years now and we've never once shared a word about emotions except for anger because that's what men are allowed to feel. Even when I went to the hospital I just said yeah won't be around my phone for a few days, text you after if you need me. The only friends I've ever felt like I could express myself emotionally to have always been female friends but that causes some problems when I end up relying way too much on a few people.



I got in a bad car accident one night a couple months ago during a big fight with my now ex and I broke down crying in the car while I waited for help. The police officer who came asked if I was physically hurt and I said no (thankfully I really wasn't) and he said why are you crying then? And then asked how old I am. Uh maybe because my day is already terrible and then I just spun out into a ditch at 65mph and I'm scared and upset.. Why would the first thing you say to anyone in this situation be a criticism.



Or at work. When a female coworker is having a bad day it's ok for them to express it and I envy that because some days I just feel *terrible* all day, literally not worthy of living and absolutely awful and I just have to be straight faced and casual all day or I'll seem super weird",64,bi4hae,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bi4hae/why_does_everyone_care_so_much_about_how_guys/,2019-04-27
28,"My coworkers always get each other free drinks from Starbucks (they’re friends with the people at the Starbucks next door from our restaurant), and they never ask if I want anything. I feel left out, and I always give them leftover cakes I baked and they never think of me when getting drinks.","Sorry if this post is stupid but, I’m feeling left out from this, and frappes make my day and I don’t really have the money to buy frappes (work two jobs and most of my money goes to bills and the little I have leftover to save is for my future apartment). I even overheard them talking about getting each other drinks again, and just told them “would be cool if I got a chocolate chip frappe those are my favorite”, and when my coworker came back she got drinks for four of my coworkers (they get them for free cause they know people at Starbucks) and then tells me “sorry lcrazy I was carrying so many drinks that I forgot about yours”. 

Then I go in today and chatted up one of the Starbucks employees she was really cool and we were talking about how it’s hard to be on a diet when working food service, and I told her if she ever wants free food from my restaurant (which is next door and some Starbucks employees buy food from us), to just mention my name and I can hook her up and all she said was “huh? What?”, and when I tried to explain it again she just kept having trouble with what I was trying to say.

29,Wanted to share the little things that have helped me tremendously....just in case it could help you too.,"So I've had depression for about 9 years now. It all started in college for me when my anxiety went through the roof, and then after a couple of years of anxiety depression kicked in hard. I am 30 years old now and through therapy and medication, I was able to find out ways to pinpoint what affected me the most; now I still have depression but its much much more manageable and I no longer take any medicine or see anyone for it. Here are the things that really helped me! Some are simple, but I wanted to list them all; I have found that when depressed, it was very hard for me to actively think about ways to make myself better. Hoping this list can maybe help another as well and also be a reminder for me when I am having a hard time. (Bold for TLDR)

\- \*\*Seeking medicine and therapy\*\* so that I could lower my depression in order to realize what I needed to do to get better was one of the most important decisions.

\- Focusing on making my wife/friends happy instead of focusing on how I was feeling. I have found that when I am depressed I am so focused on myself; \*\*focusing on others\*\* not only made them feel good but it also helped me as well.

\- Going to bed and waking up at roughly the same time was very important for me. Heck...just sleeping is important! Studies have shown that \*\*getting good sleep\*\* alone can be as effective as taking anti depressants.

\- \*\*Limiting actions that gave me temporary happiness\*\* but that didn't make me feel like I accomplish anything or gave me personal growth. Limit living in a fantasy mindset; examples for this are video games, porn, social media, alcohol, phone games, tv shows, etc... When I was very depressed, I tended to live in my mind all the time; switching to focusing on my life, the present, and what I was doing with it was huge for me.

\- Directly related to above, plan your day out and try to do things that do give you personal growth or make you \*\*feel like you accomplished something\*\*. These could be small, they just need to make you feel like you did something good for yourself or another. Making a list and crossing things off of them is one of the best feeling for me! Some of mine example of this are chores, drawing, learning a new skill or language, reading, and some others below.

\- \*\*Exercising\*\* a little bit every other day (even just 20-30 mins). Not only can you meet people this way, it will also give you endorphins, give you energy, and make you feel like you're doing good for your body. Feeling low energy was a big depression problem of mine. (this also falls under accomplishments for me)

\- \*\*Having a dog\*\* helped me a lot, it makes you get out of the house for walks and or dog park; this helped me make friends and also the walk is really relaxing. I have noticed that just \*\*being outside\*\* is good for me.

\- \*\*Eating.\*\* This is a bit of a silly one but I noticed that sometimes I was just feeling down because I didn't have anything to eat in a long time.

\- \*\*Meditate!\*\* I have found that so much of my time when in depression was focused on living in my past or future; meditation made me remember to \*\*focus on the now\*\*, the present, and really appreciate it.

\- Asking myself why I am feeling the way I am, almost like having a conversation with myself. \*\*Planning out my day\*\* so that I am actively going about doing things that I know will affect me in a positive way was great guidance I was able to receive from a therapist.

\- \*\*Taking care of myself physically\*\*. I am a guy, and I have noticed that making myself dress more nicely and making sure I was well groomed makes me feel good and made a difference in how I went about my day.

\- \*\*Drink lots of Water!\*\* It's amazing how much better you'll feel and how much more energy you'll have just from creating this habit. \*\*Eating healthier\*\* and  trying to cook at home is another change I made, matter of fact, cooking and getting better at cooking is another thing I use as accomplishments.

\- Lastly,\*\* focusing on actions instead of emotions.\*\* This one is probably one of the hardest to do when depressed because your emotional mind is dominant over your logical mind, but it is so crucial. \*\*Focusing on what you can DO instead of how you are feeling was a game changer for me.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Wow, this is a lot longer than I thought it was going to be but even if 1 of these things helps somebody out there...it will have been worth it to write it all out. Like I said above, I still have crappy days and I am not great all the time, but I feel like I do have much better days than I used to. I would love to read if any of these things were helpful in your own life, or even if you have another suggestion that you feel has made a big difference for you!

I’m doing okay in school, making some big life changes I’ve been wanting to do for so long, and feeling close to my family and friends. But I still feel depressed. I think part of it is from thinking about how fucked up and superficial this world is. All about money, power, and status. I hate it. I do often tie my self worth to my productivity. Yeah I’m doing well in school, but do I hate it? Yes. It makes me so miserable. But it makes my parents happier that I’m going to college, happier than they would be if I were a barista. Why can’t success be about how happy and content you are with life instead of a title? I know it is for some people, maybe I just have to try to be one of them.

41,My dad is dying and this is supposed to be the happiest time in my life.,"My father had a massive pulmonary embolism one week ago and has been in the ICU since. He cannot move his arms, legs, head, or talk. He is in there mentally. He knows me. He has brain damage and neurologists and doctors are not sure if he'll be able to recover, or if this is it for him. He has said a million times to me and my sister that if he ever has to go to a nursing home then he just wants to die. Whenever I say ""I love you, dad"" he tries so hard to say it back but cries because he can't.   


I graduate with my master's degree in two weeks. I bought a wedding dress yesterday. I am job searching. This is supposed to be such an exciting time in my life, but all I can think about is how my dad won't be at my graduation. He won't walk me down the aisle. He won't dance with me at my wedding. He won't be there to help me find a house and move into it. All I can think about is how I'm supposed to be celebrating all these milestones with him but he won't be there for any of it. He's my best friend.

I have almost no friends because of language barriers, and I just don’t feel compatible with even anyone.  

Even though I’m not antisocial, I just tend to suppress all the shit I’m feeling. But recently I’ve been shutting down more and more and just not wanting to talk about anything or to anyone. Even when my girlfriend asks if I’m okay I don’t even know what to reply and I just shrug or mumble “mhm”. 

I feel like I’m dumb when I’m around other people who are in college and striving for more ambitious things and I’m just settling for attending a programming boot camp because I don’t have any other options. 

I lay in bed till the afternoon because I couldn’t care less about any obligations even though they’re important.

Because the days where I'm sitting around, doing nothing, are the days that I'm letting myself down. Everytime I wake up late, I'm letting myself down. Everytime I don't leave the house, again, I'm letting myself down. It's going to be really fucking hard to kick it. And it's remarkable because for the past few weeks I'd been planning to top myself. I've tried to before and I regret it. The last time I spent a week in hospital. There's nothing more lonely than being in a hospital bed after trying to kill yourself. And now I fucking promise myself, anything I want is achievable, but it isn't gonna happen waiting for others to do it for me. Life isn't worth giving up on.

List of medications/drugs my body actually reacted to:

Lexapro: all it did was wall me in to this claustrophobic dystopian existance of ""meh"" emotions, meaning I only ever had one emotion and it was ""meh"" which is a horrible way to live trust me.

Latuda: Helped my psychotic symptoms but I've already built up a tolerance to it so it is starting to not work again (and I'm on the highest dose)

Medical Marijuana (THC): Helps me with sleep, anxiety, and depression but at the cost of increasing psychotic symptoms. It's also not legal in my state and wont be for years.

Dextromethorphan Hbr: (On third/fourth plat doses) Helps with sleep, anxiety, and depression, for me has no effect on psychotic symptoms, but this is not something you can take like a medication, you have to wait between doses or it can really mess you up.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm meeting with my Psychiatrist tomorrow, and I'm just gonna have him take me off my meds because it's just a waste of money. My plan is to move to a state with medical marijuana because from my experiences that's my best option and it won't destroy my brain like DXM would.

&amp;#x200B;

Oddly enough, I still find it strange that all the medications I tried (almost all of which I swear to God are placebos) are legal but Marijuana, LSD, and Psylocybin Mushrooms are illegal (and all 3 that I just listed are safer than the other medications I took and wayyyyy safer than opioids). It just feels to me like the pharmaceutical companies work with the government behind closed doors and they don't really care that they're ruining people's lives and just want money. 

&amp;#x200B;

One last thing, I can't talk to therapists because 1. It doesn't help me and 2. I can't trust telling them about my substance use. I know self-medication is frowned upon, but I've been severely depressed for over half my entire life and I've gotten significantly better results by handling it myself, especially since I know myself better than anyone else does.

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr: I've been put on just about every med there is and no legal drugs help. Gonna get my Psychiatrist to take me off all my meds (waste of money and time). It's BS that weed is illegal and opioids and alcohol are legal. Therapists don't help and get upset if I mention self-medication so I'm at the point where I just want to tell them all to fuck off so I can actually help myself better than those quacks could.",29,biitgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/biitgg/i_feel_like_medications_are_a_scam/,2019-04-29

60,I wrote a poem to describe what depression feels like,"
I wait to fall back asleep again, 
for the dark fog to roll over me again, that inner eclipse. More and more I want to not be here—
not to be dead, exactly, but to slip down out of existence like sliding into a pool. 
When I was young I thought the world was boundless and golden and landscaped with light, 
beams striking brilliance from one end of the earth to the other. Now my world has shrunk, 
collapsing inwards like skin. 
I’m not the girl I used to be—I’m not a girl at all, really, but the word “woman” blooms large and round in my mouth, full of vowels like rolling hills, 
and I’m not like that either. 
I’m not fertile or lush. 
I’m flat and hollow like the bottoms of canyons, 
sparse pits swimming in rotting fruit. 
My skin turns bitter when you put your hands on it. When you say my name, it turns to acid

I really feel like garbage right now. I hate my total lack of motivation/initiative. I have three or four tests next week (i don't even fucking know), none of which I've studied for, none of which I've paid attention in class for and none of which I've done any homework for. I told myself I would do some work and be productive this weekend, just like every other weekend. Guess what I did this weekend? Absolutely jack shit. I didn't even open my backpack except to get a bag of chips. I have a mini quiz tomorrow and earlier today said that I was gonna study for it. Then bedtime rolls around and I'm playing league like a fucking retard saying ""oh I'll just stay up a little later to do it"". What did I do? Play more fucking league. I'm not even good at that either. All I ever do is watch youtube, browse reddit and play league. I'm not good for a single thing in the world. I won't ever amount to anything meaningful and I'm just a complete liability to society. My whole existence is defined by how I trouble every single person I come into contact with. My family, classmates, teachers, teammates, random people on the bus, etc. I just wish I could just cease to exist which is much better than I deserve but at least the world could be a slightly less disgusting place.",24,bikzgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bikzgf/im_trash/,2019-04-29
66,I was billed over $2000 for trying to commit suicide.,"One night, I was having a horrible day at my already stressful fast food job and my friends and coworkers were treating me like complete garbage like they usually do and I guess something in me just broke. 

I didn’t yell or cause a scene or anything when it happened. I left work and walked down to a nearby gas station where I bought all of my favorite candies and drinks. I took the treats with me to a highway walk bridge and sat there for an hour crying and eating my snacks. When I was finished, I contacted the crisis text line as one last cry for help and talked to them for nearly an hour. I told them about what had happened and that I was up on that bridge and didn’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know if someone saw me up there or if the crisis line contacted the police but three police officers talked me down and brought me to a hospital in an ambulance. 

At the hospital, they confiscated all my stuff and I was forced to strip and change into a jumpsuit in front of a cop. They kept me in a locked cell until 3 AM while they tracked down an emergency psychiatrist. I wasn’t allowed to sleep and all they gave me to eat was a soggy turkey and mustard sandwich. The psychiatrist came in and gave me a bunch of brochures for therapy then they kicked me out of the hospital and left me alone on the streets with nowhere to go. I called an Uber to get back home and told absolutely nobody what I went through.

The only person I trusted to talk about this with, a work friend of mine, went and told another coworker who told another one and so on. I got one day off of work and when I came back everyone was avoiding me. 

A week after all this went down, I received a hospital bill for over $2000 which I still haven’t paid off. I’m still stuck in the same shitty job except now I’ve got nobody else to turn to for help. I know I’m just going to end right back up there on that bridge soon but this time I think I’m going to do it.

67,Does anyone else get extra depressed when it’s around the time of their birthday/special holidays??,"Long story short, I [24F] had a child at 16 (single mother) I was also self destructive for a veryyyyy long time and was just diagnosed with cptsd in the middle of last year. I feel like I have broken the chain and my daughter is the only one in my family who shows me a lot of love and she is just really different. I know it is because of me and the way I’ve raised her.. anyway, when it comes around to my birthday and what not, I can’t help but feel extra empty around this period? I don’t know why, and people keep telling me to look at the positives and to look at how far I have become, but it’s just really hard. I feel like I’m never enough and ever since I’ve come out of the mental health facility recently, I’ve also literally lost all my friends, which I am a bit sad about. I don’t know, i thought I would of achieved so much more by the time I’ve turned 25 but I feel like as I get older, It’s become harder to cope?

For me the meaning of life is just to enjoy the time you have here and make it the best you can, i just can't seem to enjoy anything anymore... 

I'm enrolled in the study I've always wanted to do and still really think it's interesting, i just don't have the energy to do anything. I hate going to school because I'll have to get out of bed, i hate being at school because it reminds me of how much I'm behind with everything. 

I always look forward to free days, but whenever i have a day off i get reminded by how lonely i am. I'm socially a wreck and just find it so hard to make and maintain friendships. My enormous hate for myself makes it so hard for me to see why people would want to be friends with me.
Most of my social interaction is through discord, I even have a huge crush on a girl i met online, it makes me feel so incredibly pathetic. We're friends but even though i know she won't ever want to be with me romantically (i fucking asked like a pathetic loser) i can't seem to stop thinking about her that way. I don't want to lose her as a friend but just being friends hurts. I'm torturing myself with these thoughts 

I just really don't want to live anymore, but i also don't want to die, i can't do that to my family. Every time i think of ending it all i just get the image of my parents, my sisters and my little nephew crying and wondering why i did it and i just burst into tears. I'll never want to do that to them but I'm scared that I'm just going to snap one day

I just feel like I'm trapped in life, i don't want to be here but i just can't get out

74,I struggle to hold down a job. I'm so lonely and bored it's driving me crazy. Please help reassure me out of this loop,"TL;DR can I break out of a long pattern of being the stereotypical depressed person lying in bed or staying at home all day after doing it when things get tough for 10+ years? I have made progress over the years but the loneliness and boredom is crushing me where I am now. I really need someone to talk to.

My brain is all over the place. I'm coming up to a breaking point. I cried myself to sleep last night. I need to keep trying, I don't want to succumb to misery. I want to work on myself but the isolation is crushing me. I'm on my own all day, 5 days a week, it's killing me.

Basically I've been depressed since I started high school, I stopped attending school on a regular basis, would just stay home in bed, I managed to scrape by and get into university, but haven't successfully moved past this pattern of behaviour, I spent the 9 months I moved away for university in my dorm room in bed mainly, I dropped out, came home, spent years at home either in bed or going out partying (which helped in a lot of ways, I found amazing friends, more confidence, the community of friends to feel like I had a real home in this city, eventually I met my boyfriend as well who I now live with who is very supportive financially and emotionally).

After a couple years at home, I did get my current job, it's a gig job, it was a bit more stable then, but I just got it because it was a job and my plan was to build up slowly with it, till I felt better, then when I felt better I could think about university again (or whatever other game plan). I put off moving in with my boyfriend for ages because I wanted to be able to support myself financially, or at least know I could do regular hours, I had saved up some plus I was doing regular hours when I did move in with him, but have barely been working for a year or so now, burned through my savings, relying on him and family now. But I did build up with work slowly, to working around 25-30 hours regularly plus volunteering (which kind of took over my life for a couple years), but then I couldn't handle it, I stopped communicating with anyone in the volunteer organisation, I was working less and less and then my contract changed for much worse so even less work, for even less money... 

I found a vocational course that I've been doing for the last few months, it broke for Easter and restarting tomorrow, I enjoy it but for now it's only two half days a week, for the next eight weeks. I'm so bored not doing anything full time but I'm so scared that I can't handle it. I'm thinking about applying for whatever bar work or temp jobs for short term but really struggling with the motivation and discipline to actually apply. I'm not completely unskilled but I get so awkward with people the more lonely and depressed I am, so it can be really anxiety-inducing. I'm also thinking about other volunteer roles, there's one in particular I'd love to apply for that sounds well-trained and well-structured (something that I think would be excellent for me, I flounder without structure), I need the moral support on this, my boyfriend is great, I do have good friends and family but of course everyone has their lives and work and then here I am thinking thinking thinking on my own going batshit!

I know to some extent I need to kick my ass into gear, but I need some understanding, some solidarity, I need to know I'm not alone, not just the tough love guilt-inducing thoughts of needing to shape up and be a real adult. I do a lot of thinking to try to be kind to myself, to forgive myself, I have done a lot of work on that. I do tell myself the ways that I am trying and maturing and how I feel more and more ready to step up and do the daily grind, how I want to be a reliable and stable person. I've made big steps in my communication as a partner, in my relationships with family and friends, in keeping my house clean, tidy, and nicely decorated, my diet, making nice healthy, even creative, meals for us, I make efforts to exercise but struggle with the consistency, same with efforts of just getting out of the house, I try to come up with things like I'll try walk partway with my boyfriend when he goes to work, also meditation, taking better care of my appearance... So I do try, the consistency is of course the difficult part, ultimately the biggest problem is getting knocked back by the loneliness and isolation.

I'm trying to get back into my gig job, at least temporarily for discipline, self-esteem and cash, but it's low-paid, physically exerting (so it's difficult for me to pick up on and off if I'm laying around depressed most of the time), basically soul-destroying because I'm on my own all day with that too, staring at my phone all day.

I'm extremely online and sick of it, I feel addicted to the internet and I feel like it's terrible for my concentration. I do read/watch/play some things I think are worth doing on the internet, but it's way too much and my concentration is shot for reading books, talking to people, doing much of anything productive - it's the easiest procrastination device. And I feel like I have no willpower against procrastination.

I've had therapy over the years, the last therapist was the most consistent, but I stopped last year when my own money ran out. I could ask for help on paying for therapy, but I've lost a bit of hope with it for now. Also feel like the money could go better towards exercise classes, social outings, general living expenses.

Please help! Mainly just to to feel less alone and that I can work through this. I feel a bit better having typed this out. I'm so tired of feeling like I exist in a vacuum during the day while everyone else is at work. Sorry it's a bit jumbled, I mainly just wanted to get my thoughts out.

While learning about the medical side of depression is important and helpful, I've found that, for me at least, identifying myself as a ""depressed person"" medically speaking has hindered my healing journey and led to lots of frustration. There are definitely physiological components to depression. I'm not saying to ignore your doctor's advice or not take meds or anything like that. But when you're constantly told that you are mentally ill, that your perspective is warped, that you are victims of cognitive distortions all the time, it can really cement the notion that you are a defective person, and that the things you feel are somehow unreal. For me, it took me a very long time to even consider the possibility of having a purpose in life because I generally view life and the world as a very negative, stressful experience, and when going to psychologists, I was always told that my worldview was abnormal or wrong in some form or another. Doctors would never even address it really. They'd hear how stressed and suicidal I had become and they'd simply increase the dosage on my anti-depressants. Recently though, I experienced a breakthrough that helped me a great deal. I thought ""Maybe I'm not crazy....maybe the world really IS generally stressful and negative and life's going to be hard....but maybe now that I know that, I can come to terms with my worldview and work to help heal myself and others as best as I can."" When we express our deep, painful feelings to people we trust and get told that ""oh, that's just negative thinking"" or ""it'll get better someday"", it can really hurt and invalidate our suffering at times. It implies that there's a ""right and wrong way to think/feel"" and that, because you view things more pessimistically or get overwhelmed and stressed easily, your thoughts must be ""wrong"" and so must be worked on and corrected. This can lead to years of frustrating therapy where you still believe and feel the things your pain tells you no matter how much you get told to ignore it or replace it with more positive thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

Once again, this approach may not be for everybody. Some people find it liberating to view their negative thoughts as an illness, and that's okay. I also want to stress that its very important to be actively working to distinguish which thoughts might be hinting at something deeper that you believe in and those which are unhealthy coping mechanisms or fueled by negative psychological reinforcement. Self-deprecating thoughts like ""I hate myself"", ""I'm worthless"", and such are probably not the whole ""truth"", and should be considered with caution. But, if you're like me and feel that there's just this vague, overwhelming feeling that ""something is wrong with the world"", I would suggest paying attention to your feelings and not outright dismissing them every time someone suggests they're wrong. They might be insights into some core beliefs that shape you as a person, and could potentially help you move on from them.",25,biuhvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/biuhvb/reminder_that_youre_not_crazy_and_your_feelings/,2019-04-29

99,Is it possible to get a therapist without knowledge of parents?,"I've talked about getting a therapist with my parents before but they're adamant I seek a religious therapist. My dad is a Christian pastor and my mom is an incredibly devout Christian. I struggle to open up to people and the couple times I tried to open up with my parents they just urge me to turn to my faith, which doesn't help because I'm a closeted non-believer. Earlier this year I called my dad crying because I just dropped out of college and really just needed someone there for me and he just said I can't help you this is something you have to talk to God about.

It's been a few months since this conversation and I've been doing ok mentally, until this past week. I've always thought about if I've had depression or not but these past few days have confirmed it. I literally slept for 14 straight hours and called of work because I just didn't want to move. I've really given up on hygiene and generally feel completely hopeless and don't care about anything. Non of these symptoms are new I've just been able to live with them, but I've never felt so completely miserable, sad, and overwhelming hopeless until these past 24 hours or so.


I've really only ever had one person in my life I've been able to open up to, and I just really wish I could talk to someone about this. I feel like a therapist would be a great opportunity for me to finally open up and discuss my mental problems in a serious environment. This post is my first time really admitting my probelms publically, even though it's technically anonymous. 

I've gotten really sidetracked in the point of the post, but really I have no idea how to go about actually getting a therapist. I'm on my parents insurance so I'm assuming there is no real way to do this on my own, but I am pretty ignorant on how this stuff works so I figured I'd ask just in case. I really don't want a religious therapist because I don't even consider myself religious, and, ironically, I feel like most of my mental problems stem from my parents insistence that I share their faith and their refusal to see anything else as a viable option for me.",21,bixglb,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bixglb/is_it_possible_to_get_a_therapist_without/,2019-04-30

101,What I learned after 6 years of depression,"* **There is no ""if i just had... &lt;&gt;, id be happy""**. I thought if i moved out of my parents house, i wouldn't be depressed. I thought if I had a girlfriend, I wouldn't be depressed. I thought if I had my dream job, I wouldn't be depressed. Turns out after achieving or having all those things, it only made a temporary difference. 3 months max. Depression will always come back as its apart of you and who you are.
* **Its best to be open about it.** I hid my depression for 4 years, it drained me and it was fucking lonely. Being open about it to your hopefully existing friends takes a huge weight off you not having to be someone your not. Now im surrounded with friends that have similarities to me, We once stood up at night just crying to each other because of the  stuff that we were going through - i didn't feel so lonely.  ""*Being someone else drains you, being yourself replenishes you naturally*""
* **Do the little things that can help.** Unfolllow your ex on instagram, delete his/her number or photos. (unpopular opinion) stop closely following r/depression. Get rid of the things in your life that can give you a reason and remind you to be sad.
* **Depression sucks, anxiety is much worse**. They tend to go hand in hand like brother and sister. If you got both, there is help for anxiety. Try some of the over-prescribed medication out there. Ive been on some for about 5-6 months now and the amount ive achieved because of it contrasts me from being a kid to a successful adult. 
* **Im proud and thankful for my depression.** Yes I cry alot, and for no reason sometimes. Yes I dont want to get out of bed some days. Yes I get massively unmotivated to do anything but stare at my ceiling. But all that has made the person I am today. Im caring, empathetic, and I have the power to see right people and see there current emotion by a 2 second glance. Im fucking &lt;insert name here&gt; and **as long as im alive im winning the fight against depression.**",84,bixr1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bixr1y/what_i_learned_after_6_years_of_depression/,2019-04-30

107,Self Care tip from an Inuit person,"This might seem out of the blue so to speak. But I struggle with depression myself and occasionally find my way out due in large part to some of my spiritual beliefs, so I want to share them in case they can help someone else. I am an Inuit descended person from Labrador. The entire coast of Labrador was converted to Christianity almost overnight in 1804, but our way of life is not centered around a single community. Much of our time is spent in what we call ""the Big Land"", the countryside, where traditional hunting and spiritual practices are closer at hand than the looming church. Further north, there were Inuit shaman as late as the 1990s, and so some of the knowledge of a culture and spirituality thousands of years old has survived.

&amp;#x200B;

Shaman had a number of responsibilities. Healing the sick was easily their weakest skill set (seriously one of their cures was to put a feather on a wound and blow on it). But for healing the sad and scared they had tremendous success, and communities lived or died by the love of their shaman. The shamanic healing art is primarily an act of love and that is why it works. There are no internal physical changes that need to take place for it to be effective, no surgery, punishment, or reward. All that is required is a relationship of trust with the shaman, so that as he tires on the healing journey, he can lean on you, and you on him, and you walk a road of healing together as friends. The journey is metaphysical, it is a search for a missing piece of your soul, that you find when you are in the loving arms of another human being.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the most important part of my post, I want to tell you an old secret. We are not the owners of our minds and bodies. We experience these things, but they are owned by another creature called an Inua. Inua own everything in the universe, even individual stones. It all belongs to an autonomous life force and a reality we don't get to physically touch, electromagnetism pushes every atom apart so we are mostly made of empty space. So what is an Inua? The word itself means owner, but Inua don't present themselves as physical entities: YOU are its physical entity. The Inua is often represented artistically as a one eyed woman or child, the one eye being an inner eye, because the Inua is as blind to our external reality as we are blind to our internal one.

&amp;#x200B;

So how to apply this to self care? Well, realize that the mind and body get sick and die, but the Inua and its love are permanent. Just as a meteor leaves an impact crater, love leaves a beautiful mark on the world too. The world is created by love between animals and people building up over billions of years, so that each creature and each person leaves a  rock on the shore of time that will never wash away. We are the result of love we don't see or feel anymore, but it was here, and we stand on it blindly as sure as we stare blindly up at the night sky and don't see the gamma rays or X rays that are the most powerful forms of light.

&amp;#x200B;

Take care of your Inua. It is the source of all peace and joy in your life, and it loves your body and your mind like a proud parent does. Like a child it wants to run and play and breathe easy and roll in the grass. But life is troublesome, and we get discouraged by obstacles, we get bogged down and feel inadequate to our jobs and goals, and then, we get sick inside. We verbally attack ourselves, put down our beautiful bodies, our unique minds, and the Inua hurts. It wants to show you the body it made for you, like a child holding up a drawing. When you put down this wonderful creation, it cries like a disappointed child. Don't put down your Inua. Don't hurt its feelings. Learn to want what your Inua wants, love what it does, what it can create, recognize what is possible for you because you have a gift from a strange and unknowable Source.

&amp;#x200B;

When you are best friends with your Inua you will find the greatest happiness in life. As I said I struggle with depression due to my circumstances, but I have honestly never hated or attacked myself. In the forest of depression, I often see a light through the trees: my own light. Someday I know my Inua will guide me out of the dark woods forever. :)

What is the point of living just to be a corporate money making machine just to even make a living? What is the point of being the source of joy for others if I myself do not have any source of joy?

114,Social anxiety has very likely destroyed my life.,"I'm a 19 year old high school senior with absolutely 0 friends in school and I will be kicked out of the school at the end of this trimester.

For those wondering, I go to an alternative high school, which is a place made specifically to help high school students who were having trouble with regular school and needed smaller and more teacher-student focused courses. It doesn't have semesters like a normal high school, but the school year is divided up into trimesters so kids can get more credits quickly.

I was never a fan of this school. The entire reason I was sent there in the first place was because I didn't have glasses in freshman year and couldn't see the board so I had difficulty learning as everything past a foot in front of my face gets unreadably blurry. I told the teachers this and I guess they decided the best course of action would be to just send me off to the alternative school instead of actually trying to help me.

I cannot understate just how much I loved the normal high school. Up until freshman year, I was always the kid who people in class would throw trash at, or call gay and retarded because thats was what was funny back then, or just simply beaten up after lunch in the field outside. Needless too say, this scarred me for the rest of my life, and to this day I lay in bed some nights wondering how people can be so cruel to someone else just for the sake of laughter.

This all changed in freshman year and people treated me with respect and I had many close friends whom I would talk to daily and I felt like a real person. The summer after 8th grade I was preparing myself for even more beatings and even more name calling, but that never came. I was living in a state of bliss that I had not experienced before where I felt like a valued human being. I signed up for electives that sounded cool like AutoCAD, where you learn to model things in 3D, and I signed up for and stayed after school in my first extracurricular activity, Astronomy Club. I was friends with everyone, and I felt happiness I hadn't felt in a decade.

Of course, this all came to an end. I was struggling to keep good grades on the fact that I really couldn't see anything as I was practically blind and I was honestly living in a state of pure bliss, where I wanted to savour my newfound popularity. As a result of my failing grades, they sent me to the alternative school.

This was a completely different environment. I came from a school of order and friendliness to a place of violence and quite literal bloodshed. I have my conspiracies as to why exactly this school exists, and they all revolve around the thought that all the surrounding schools needed a place to dump their ""problem children"" to make themselves and their test scores look better, but that's just my conspiracy.

Either way, this school was nothing but chaos and disorder. Teachers cursing at the students, students throwing chairs and fighting each other in the classrooms, multiple school shooting threats that the school did nothing about, this place was my new hell. I had nothing in common with the people here and this new environment sent me into a very deep depression and gave me severe social anxiety. I locked myself away emotionally and as much as I could physically as both a coping and defensive mechanism because I was absolutely horrified at the thought of reliving the terror that was my middle school experience. I sat alone at lunch. I kept my head down almost all 8 hours of the day so that people wouldn't notice me and if they did try to talk to me I usually didn't respond. I became a total social outcast and I still am to this day.

I am not exaggerating when I say I didn't speak to anyone for almost 9 months. For some reason this place shook me to my core, and I began getting hostile with everyone, including my family as a means of trying to let out a little bit of the anger at my old school for ripping all of my friends and the best part of my life out of my hands. I stopped talking to absolutely everyone.

This went on for about a year, when I finally made friends with someone else in my situation, and we quickly became best friends, but this as well had to come to an end, as they graduated soon after. My grades slipped even more than they were at the regular high school, as I was both angry and depressed at everything in life that took me to this point, and I don't think I've had a single trimester where I had more than 2 passing classes. My will to work towards graduating as crushed.

This is where I am now. It has been an endless limbo of failing everything and hiding from everyone for the past 4-5 years, and its finally coming to an end. The school counselor threatened me with being kicked out if I didn't pass this trimester's classes, and I don't know whether I should feel even more depressed or elated at the fact that I will finally be free of my personal hell.

As a closing and more personal note, if anyone goes to the CVHS 9th grade center, I ask that you somehow please get the counselor to read this. I want them to see what they do to people they send here.

121,I am,"Hi, my name is Ben and I am feeling a little down on my luck today, let's talk about who we are. 




I am a young man from the country of Scotland - an already depressing place to live without my own perceptions of it. 

I am only 20, as you have now learned and I, right now, feel completely useless, as does anyone who has their midlife or even elderly existential crisis. 

I am struggling every day to maintain this metaphorical balance that I persist to see remain still. I have been diagnosed with depression, autism and a few anxiety disorders - all of which seek to turn this balance that I seek into a bloody seesaw. Up and down, up and down, up and down. I'd find it funny, if it wasn't so damn painful to laugh. We all laugh at others tribulations, even if it hurts us. 

I am no better nor worse than the next man. I study Software Development at a college that I do enjoy studying under, I work at a tech and hardware shop that I personally enjoy working for (even if it sucks some days) and I have a very loving although difficult family that seeks to do everything in their power to help me - even if they get annoyed by me. Haha...

I am not ugly, nor am I stupid - but everyday I feel as though I am. I am always told by friends, family, colleagues, peers and so on that I have a great mind, with great potential. A young man, with all the ability to do what I want but no drive nor confidence to do so. All I need to do is just get over this bout of depression and see the real deal by facing it head on. But I don't want to for I see no way of doing so. Instead, I continue insulting myself, complaining about myself and my actions, being in others eyes ""humble"" or ""modest"" when in reality I just hate hearing praise coming my way, it makes me wince and cringe which in turn upsets me. 

I am that which lacks confidence in myself, and the scary thing is that everything I am telling you, my flaws (though not fully extrapolated) and so on, I have become fully aware of to the point in which I casually notice them in my character yet I do nought to rectify nor solve my issues. This ties into what I want to continue on with. 


I am stubborn. 

I am not what I want to be, yet I seek no resolution for I am quizzically comfortable with my position.

I am young, but feeling so old.

I am giving myself a headache just thinking about this while I'm actually sick.

136,(21F) Terminating my pregnancy...,"I come from a very strict catholic Hispanic family (I am not religious, btw). All my life I've suffered from depression and anxiety due to domestic violence that has now transformed into a panic disorder. I have my suspicions that I am actually in a early stage schizophrenia but due to low income I am unable to get help. I have no friends at all since my disorder has made everyone go away which makes me feel very lonely but anyway...  
(I am also not sure if my story belongs in this sub)  


Three days ago I found out I was about 4 weeks pregnant. I have a very loving respectful relationship with my partner (22M, a year and half together) and we have both decided to terminate the pregnancy next Thursday. Sadly, our part time jobs does nothing to help us pay for the services but we are hopeful they will help us at the location (who has many non-profit organizations able to provide help). I am also a college student with tremendous stress for finals, the more weight on my shoulders the more the disorder messes with my head.

This morning as I was getting ready to take the bus to work I went into a full on break down. As I was a street away from home I went into a maniac state. My mind blocked.. I didn't know who I was, where I was or what to do. I walked in circles for about 15 minutes crying with no clue on how to calm down and people staring (even shouting things) at me, I was even more scare. After what seemed forever I called my boyfriend's family members for help which only his cousin answer and drove me safely to my boyfriend's home.

My desperation is growing. My family doesn't know and I really don't want any one close to me to find out. The fear is growing in my head and the emotional stress is putting on me has caused a major depression period in my life. With two weeks left of school I cannot concentrate towards my finals or my work. I have no support group other than my boyfriend and the situation is leaving me with a huge painful whole in my heart. Everything has been making me break down into tears and feeling ashamed of my failure. 

I am not ready for what's about to come and the fear keeps me awake. As I feel like life gets better something drastic always messes my life. It's like if I am not meant to be happy in this lifetime.

Therefore, I tried to concentrate on my studies and focus on improving myself. It kinda worked. I got really good grades and a scholarship. In my teen years, I even consistently held school ""leadership positions"". I even made a lot of friends and was pretty sociable.

Then something just... Happened. People just  REALLY took flight and I didnt. I had to do a few jobs/ take on a few internships and realised I was always a step behind everyone else my age when it came to performing well. My friends from my younger years have moved on and I am finding it hard to be ""cool and mature"" enough to make new friends. Even my younger brother seems more ""adult"" life than me with a much healthier social life.  

Now, I still get good grades in university, But all it does is give me stress. I know my test scores are meaningless as I cant do anything else well besides studying. When I score well, I feel so empty as it isnt worth anything. Being a good ""teacher's pet"" when I was younger meant nothing. All my ""leadership positions"" in school meant nothing as I couldnt bring them into the real world. Im now just left with expectations placed upon me when I was younger that I just feel like I cant keep up with.

I feel so frustrated. My parents would always tell their friends how proud they are about my scholarship and I feel so stressed out knowing I am probably going to let them down. They do tell me that no matter what happens they will feel proud of me. But that just makes me feel worse. I dread the day I actually have to start working at the company who offered me my scholarship as they will probably judge me for not living up to their expectations  because I seem to screw up a lot. My hobbies are all really childish and isolatory like reading old fantasy books, watching youtube vidoes and reading memes. My friend's hobbies are organising workshops to educate others on the importance of engineering, volunteering to tutor kids, clubbing and making connections and travelling to signifcant cultural sites. Trust me Ive tried to take on these hobbies but anytime I try and take part in group hobbies I always feel so inferior and like a wet blanket. Like everyone around me are butterflies and Im still a urgly caterpillar.

Im still forever stuck as ""wasted potential"", if there ever was any potential in the first place. I dunno where or what I did wrong to suddenly stop progressing.

I was younger, I could force myself to go through with activities I’ve committed to regardless of what state my mental health was in but I cannot do that anymore; haven’t been able to for about a year. 

I will lie to my friends when canceling, saying that I’m working late or an opportunity for overtime was presented to me and I gotta take it (none of which is true). I do this because I feel that this excuse appears “valid”, as opposed to me saying “I’m really not feeling great, mentally and o need to be by myself”. The work excuse won’t be questioned whereas the truth will be: I’ve heard the typical rebuttals: “oh come on! Once you get here, you’ll have fun! Push yourself through this! This is happening again?” 
I don’t want to deal with any of that.

I keep feeling like I should make some friends IRL and go out and do something like a normal being in their 20s should. But the more I think about it, the more it sounds horrible. How would I even go out to meet anyone when I can't even get out of bed on days off from work? Or have the motivation to play a video game?

I've had people tell me I make them depressed. Or I'm too much to handle. Should be glad they're still around.
I can't put someone through that. I'm horrified of making someone depressed. I'm scared no one would want to befriend me or say no due to being mentally ill.
Then friends just seem...like so much work. So much work and it'll easily tire me out and I won't see the point to even socializing even more so. I cancel therapy sessions and doctor appointments due to depression and I /need/ to go to those, so I know for sure I would cancel plans that aren't needed too easily.

I have an online friend and a girlfriend. My girlfriend keeps pushing me to make friends IRL, too, which is just....stressing me out now. My therapist wants the same as well.
Other than depression, there are other illnesses I suffer from which really just...makes things harder than they should be.
I don't know, it just feels pathetic. I have no friends, I'm trapped in a work + sleep routine with nothing else to it, and don't do a thing more than that unless it's a good day.

I had friends in high school, but they were more so, school friends, and after graduation I just couldn't keep them. And eventually I just stopped looking in and unfriended everyone because everyone was moving on and doing something except for me. It's just.... Even more depressing, lol. Constantly being alone isn't too much fun or really even ideal for the mind.",37,bjgshj,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bjgshj/harder_to_find_friends_making_them_keeping_them/,2019-05-01

I feel like no one wants to be around me, they only *have* to. I want to stop using social media to see if it helps but I'm going to lose the avenue I have to talk to people as friends. Plus, on the weekends it's impossible to meet up with the friends I do have and I feel so isolated.

150,Am I the only one that feels like it all hits at once?,"Over the last 3 days everything came tumbling down. Whenever I have a depressive episode, it feels like everything that can go wrong will go wrong. The two events described are what is killing me right now.

Today marks one month since my girlfriend of 13 months broke up with me, and I had no closure till three days ago. We talked about life and how we are doing, both of us aren't doing well, her over the incident that caused us to break up, and I feel terrible about it all because of how fast she ended our relationship like it was nothing to her (info about the relationship in my post on r/relationships). So, she finally reaches out to me and we talked, after we talked I felt good like I was going to be okay since I received closure. Then I began to think why I felt hopeful and okay. I then realized I'll never have a chance with her again, and lost all control I had again.

I(M16) got on the bus to go home from school yesterday and my sister, who's in middle school, was clearly crying. She asked if she could sit by me, so of course I said yes. She moved next to me and I asked what's wrong. She was scared because someone told the counsellor at her school she has been cutting and was scared of telling our parents, so I told her I'd talk to them before she did, to ensure that they wouldn't go off on her. We got home my sister ran to her room and I told my parents what the situation was and my mom understood, my dad said this literally, ""screw that! Being aggressive is how you fix this"". So I walked right up to him and straight up called him a dumbass for not understanding that's how you push people over the edge. He laughed and said ok. I went back to console my sister, and then when I came back he started calling us pussies, so I explained we can't control it, he then starts calling us attention seekers, so I go off on him about how wrong it is to call someone an attention seeker in situations like this. He laughs it off and started taking shit from me for ""disrespectful behavior"" he took my phone, changed WiFi password, and I straight up told him that my only link to the people keeping me here is in your hands right now. He laughs it off like that means nothing, like I have other people who I can run to, when I really don't. He again calls us pussies, and I stormed off.

This is just one case, but through my whole life this feels like a constant. Thanks for reading.",27,bjhdkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bjhdkv/am_i_the_only_one_that_feels_like_it_all_hits_at/,2019-05-01

All I know is that it's the worst part of the day because reality is at its clearest; I didn't want to wake up, this world is not worth waking up to, nobody understands this feeling and as a result I have no one to talk to about it. My medication isn't working, or it isn't strong enough to fight back against the first wink of consciousness that sees the nightmare I'm slowly becoming aware of. The rest of the day is a struggle to forget, but the beginning that should be spent in awe of a wonderful sunrise brings a dawn of suffering that one day I might not be able to survive. What do we do with this? Drink coffee, take a shit, and persist in this awful world where we empty our pathetic woes into Facebook and appease our capitalist overlords before shuffling off to work like good little peons day in and day out?

157,"I'm tired of hearing ""Just go to the gym"" as a cure all for depression.","Anytime anyone talks about depression, at least on Reddit, half the comments give the same generic advice ""Just go to the gym"". 

Now of course you should absolutely workout, it's good for your muscles and bones and stuff. But I'm tired of people acting like it's going to make a substantial difference for everyone with poor mental health. 

I know this isn't true because I've actually taken this advice. Before I started working out I was depressed, socially isolated, bored with existence, and fat. Now I'm depressed, socially isolated, bored with existence, but now I have abs, which is nice of course. Like, I'll admit it does cheer me up every now and then to look in the mirror and see them but it hasn't actually solved any of my major problems.

People that give this advice kinda planted the idea in my head that as soon as I got ripped a girlfriend would magically appear who would fill my life with emotional intimacy and meaning. This of course didn't happen.

Anyway my dog came upstairs and laid on the other side of my door, I came out to see him and he starts wagging his tail. I'm not the emotional type but I had a genuine tear in my eye.

163,How do you feel happy for your friends when they’re achieving everything you wanted to?,"I feel like an asshole, but I can only feel happy for my friends if they succeed in stuff I’ve never tried or never wanted to try. For example, I’m really happy for my friends who are doing well in their music studies, but I’ve hardly touched an instrument in my life. 

But I’m starting to resent my friends who are succeeding at things I like. I used to be the only psych major out of my friends but then one of my friends switched to psych, and has been doing better than me in my favorite classes with less effort, and has even become my advisor’s favorite when I used to be because suddenly his field of interest is the same as mine. He consistently scores a few points better on everything no matter how hard I try, even though I start projects weeks in advance and he usually starts a couple nights before they’re due. 

I also have a friend who has gotten into drawing and is improving at rapid speed, while I’m starting to get worse. My depression has taken the drive to draw out of me, even though it used to be my favorite thing in the world, and watching someone pass me up from drawing for a couple months, even though I’ve been drawing for years, has broken my heart. I hate to say it, but I’m starting to resent him for it. 

And nearly all my friends are getting their lives together, getting themselves to the gym when I have panic attacks trying to go due to bad past experiences, and they’re also getting great opportunities like study abroad, leadership positions, and are making lots of friends. 

I don’t want to be a hateful person, but I’m scared that I resent my friends and will come to hate them. They represent everything I’ll never be. And I hate it.

191,What’s the fucking point. 3 years of training and can’t get a job.,"Sick and fucking tired of pretending to be happy in life. My parents are both shot in the head, one bi polar the other an agoraphobic. Both want nothing to do with me as I’m to ‘middle class’ because I’m the first to get into further education of the family and actually worked hard in retail to buy my self a car with my money. 

I’m training to be a primary school teacher and the harsh reality is the job is long hours, not amazing pay and children are basically targets. I love the job and teachers are my role models in life and that’s why I aspire to be one. 

I want to give back something to children that teachers gave to me, a glimmer of light out of my mothers shit drug abuse, string of abusive partners and being frankly worthless to society. 

However 15 applications later, two unsuccessful interviews and nothing to show for it. 

My dad wants me out as soon as possible and I have very little money to fall on. Honestly the closer the deadline gets to September(when teachers term starts) the closer to I’m losing my sanity. 

Were painted this picture that you work hard in school and you’ll reek the rewards later in life. Quite frankly as I’ve got older I’ve got more depressed that the sad reality is that I’d rather be dead then go through the stresses of life. 

I’ve genuinely tried to be a nice guy in life and treat everyone with respect and work my way up, but frankly I’ve had a fucking enough of people.

198,"do any of you function normally throughout the day, laugh, smile, get things done, but still have depressive/negative thoughts?","I feel like this is my problem. when I first started taking lexapro it was okay, then I started getting suicidal thoughts, then another antidepressant which made me 100x worse, crying a lot, thoughts of driving myself off the road into a tree. it was bad, then I stopped that and things got better. i'm at the point, and have always been, where I can get up in the morning, eat, get a shower, sit on my computer all day, which really isnt good, then go to the gym at night, come home and shower again, eat. meanwhile i'm having a relatively normal day, im laughing, smiling, conversing. but meanwhile i'm thinking about how shitty my life is and how much of a loser I am and how I have no future. no drive to do anything or make anything of myself. the occasional suicidal thought, or thoughts of just running away, I get easily irritated, sometimes I feel like welling up with tears. 

I feel like I dont know how to explain my depression to my therapist, because considering how my days normally go, I wouldnt say im depressed. then you throw all of that other negative bs into the mix and i'm like yeah, theres definitely something wrong. but I just dont fucking know. i've never considered the fact that I was depressed until I started getting suicidal thoughts. like I said, although I dont enjoy things like I used to, dont have fun playing video games or watching tv, or going to the gym, I still easily manage to get through the day and feel okay. I dont know how to even explain it to someone face to face, really. like I manage, but at the same time I just think like, ""fuck man i'm such a fucking loser with no future and no drive, fuck"", and that just puts me down so much.",267,bk18eh,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bk18eh/do_any_of_you_function_normally_throughout_the/,2019-05-02

200,I lost the only person that cared about me.,"There was this girl at my workplace that I became good friends with two years ago. Back then I felt like everyone hated me because I was never invited to do anything with my coworkers. I was made fun of a lot too because I’ve got a speech impediment that makes it hard for me to talk. Whenever they’d all go out somewhere though, she’d make sure to include me. She’d always talk to me on my breaks and try to cheer me up on bad days. She never made fun of me for the way I talked and would even take me to coffee shops or other fun places after a rough shift. We even started poking at the idea of dating for a bit but it ended up in her ghosting me after only two weeks until I talked to her about it. Then we just stayed friends after that. 

That was all last year. She recently quit the job we both worked at and I just feel empty now. I tried to stay in contact with her but she doesn’t seem to care about me anymore. It’s so frustrating and I almost feel like she hates me. 

All I want in life now is to go back to last year when me and her were still great friends. I think about those good times every day and feel awful now because that was honestly the only time in my life where I truly felt at peace and that someone actually wanted me around. There has never been a single person in my life that’s ever shown me that kind of compassion. 

My depression has been hitting me really hard lately but now I’ve got nobody else to turn to for help. I’ve been contemplating suicide for the last few days because I know I can never get that happiness back again and I can’t bear living alone in this world anymore.

201,A poem I wrote. Called The Wrong Man,"**The Wrong Man**

The wrong man looks sort of like the old one

The wrong man is the increasingly colder one

He walks a half second slower

His head hangs a few degrees lower 

And on his forehead is stamped the word “dread”

He can point at the timeline where he was birthed

Recall the date when the former man was cursed 

He doesn’t like his name 

And his desire has yet to change

“Please return me to where I came”

“Destroy me along with my shame”

The former man had died many years ago

He was now a phantom until... he didn’t know

There is no former

There is only the future

I’m not dead because I’m not living

Pick up the pieces 

Clean up the messes

And eventually I will see the former man in you again

Recently, I’ve been eating much less and barely have an appetite.  I’ve used to play a lot of games for fun, but now it isn’t like what it used to be for me. Of course I was lazy when in high school, but I didn’t think too much about it. Now I know how lazy I’ve become and I hate it. It’s just hard and draining to do anything that would improve my behavior. I’ve even got to the point of blaming my parents for who I’ve become and I’ve hated myself ever since for thinking of something like that. It’s just me laying in bed and thinking of al these things and I know it’s all my fault. I’m not suicidal in anyway, but I feel like this is going to become worse. I’m not sure if I have depression.

206,Somebody please help me. Just talk to me. Anybody at all.. please. 🥺,"Hey guys. So it’s my first time posting on this sub. I don’t even know how to start so I’m going to just get straight to the point. I’ve been really fucking depressed, just gone really. And.. I attempted suicide today. I failed, obviously. Went to the hospital, and being this is my 3rd attempt I know what and what not to say to not get locked up in a ward. So I had a conversation with my ex for the first time in a few days(we just broken up recently, and it’s been killing me) and I opened up to her and I thought it’d just be easier to copy exactly what I texted her and what happened earlier today..

I couldn’t bear the pain anymore. I don’t know how to say it so I’m just going to be straight forward about it. I tried killing myself today. I’m going through so much, so fucking much and it’s getting to me to the point my heart literally aches. I don’t mean it just hurts, I mean I literally feel it, almost like a heart attack 💔 &amp; it’s not just only because of you.. so much I’m going through and the loneliness is killing me. Aside from my mom, I don’t have anybody.. I don’t have any friends, I don’t talk to anybody, nothing. I could be around a million people, ‘friends’ even, and I would still feel so alone. I spend my time doing nothing but crying and just lay in my bed all day.. I was never like that. I used to hate being stuck inside, I would always want to be out, and go out places and do things. I used to love going for walks and going through nature. I used to love just picking up flowers haha..I used to love playing my music, producing my own and playing drums .. I don’t even listen to music anymore. I don’t draw or paint anymore. I’m so dead and so numb inside. I feel like I don’t know who I am anymore.. you know what I mean by that? I’ve been going through derealization, and that’s something I wanted to talk to you about before things ended.. I don’t feel real. I don’t even feel like I exist if that makes sense.. I feel like I’m see through and I don’t even live in a real world. I’m struggling to find out who I am and what my purpose is in this life.. it’s so fucking sad.. it’s heartbreaking .. and I’ve been wanting to let this out for so long but I always felt nobody would listen. And if they did, they would just tell me I’m bugging, or just get out and fix it as if it was just In my reach and I could. Not only that, but I truly, from the bottom of my heart, hate myself. I hate the things I’ve done and the person I’ve become. I always wish you knew the 17 year old me.. I wish you had met me then and start from there. I was just.. so different. I was so honest. I would never hurt a fly. I was outgoing. I would always make people laugh and everybody would love being around me. I didn’t use drugs. I smoked weed and worked my ass off saving money for the car I should’ve been had. I feel like I wasted so much fucking time. It’s like I blinked, and all of a sudden I was an opiate addicted dumbass. All of a sudden I’m 21. And I have nothing. And after having my heart broken and thinking I would never, not ever, find another love again, I actually did. &amp; I fell In love more than I ever felt in my life. All of a sudden my future looked bright and I was finally so, so... just so happy. But it was at the wrong time. I guess I wasn’t ready to put down drugs yet. Now I can’t stand to even fucking hear that word. It took everything from me. Fucking everything. It turned me into a person that I never was. It’s like I was literally a shining bright sun, and turned into a dark moon who only glows certain days. I fucking hate myself. I rip out my hair. I punch the shit out myself. I self harm. I’m covered in bruises, cuts, and scratches. I want to die with everyday that comes. I lost everything. I lost myself. And I even lost the love of my dreams. A girl that has showed up In my dreams just time and time again. I was in heaven, but was living in hell. I hurt so much inside and everyday I live I want to die. And every step I take, I want to take a million steps back. I’m doing everything I can to heal. I walk. I got my job back at It’s Sugar just to be in an environment where it’s colorful and bright. And it’s brings back good memories. I’m excited to start school. I’m doing good things but nothing will ever take away this pain from my heart and this heavy burden I carry on my shoulders. I can’t even say for confident that I won’t try again. I fucking hate myself.

And that sums up for the most part how I’ve been feeling.. and if you’ve read this far, you don’t know how much I thank you for even taking the time to read this, I’m crying as I even type this right now. If anyone, anyone at all could just please talk to me for a bit.. 💔",40,bk3wra,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bk3wra/somebody_please_help_me_just_talk_to_me_anybody/,2019-05-03
207,This is my fix for depression (18 years long) (7 years research),"I thought I had the answers a few years ago. I thought I knew the answers.

I was wrong, I have suffered a long, long time. But I have answers, I am happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, this is a ""summary"" 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to explain my history completely, I've done it many times before.... But I'll give a summary, I had depression as a boy. I was dianogsed by a psychologist in the royal childrens hostpital. I was treated for it for 3 years at that point, I also had social anxiety disorder. I was depressed all-throughout the rest of my life for 15 years. My depression at this point wasn't resolved, I had just developed coping strategies in order to avoid it. I was re-diagnosed again at 19 with this and social anxeity disorder by a general psychologist. I went through a year of therapy which was aimed at facing my issues. I thought that love was my cure of depression because it was the one thing that I didn't have and hadn't experienced. I stopped getting therapy which was mainly aimed at anxiety around 21. At 22, I was getting viciously bullied in my workplace as I tried to finally intregrate myself into the world of dating and friendship. At this point I started developing psychosomatic disorders being pain without context or genuine phyiscal damage. I had pain morph into different parts of my body and as I tried to resolve each bit of tension in my muscles and bones. I was tested extensively by doctors and had recieved no diagnosis for my conditions. It was unknown. I started looking into sudo-science around mind body disorders and then decided I would recieve therapy again. I went back to see a different general psychologist for 6 months. I discovered that it wasn't enough with her help and moved onto seeing a clinical psychologist for over a year. I went to group therapy. And after this I got into my first relationship with the help of a friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought that the feeling of love would start to change me with this girl. It didn't. I quickly discovered what I was doing wrong, and I also quickly discovered that it wasn't the cause of my depression, the lack of love. I de-constructed by psyche at this point extensively and started looking into the causes of my reality such as unconscious influences on my life. It ended up being rounded off as a perfect storm that made me the way I was but it didn't resolve why I was the way I was. I stopped seeing my clinical psychologist and during a suicidal episodic repeat of suicidal tendecies which I had never fully commited to killing myself in I had an ambulance on me. I was sent to a psych ward and kept there for 4 days. I met all sorts of people, I talked to them about their history and disorders. I had very open conversations but it wasn't a friendly place. It made me more angry to be there, not afraid. I developed a stronger rage towards trying to find a cure for not only my depression but an overall cure for depression. I felt as if all the research I did (1000+ hours) of looking into neuroscience and psychology and even the physiology of the human body failed me because I missed things. I really felt like a failure at this point. I started becoming increasingly suicidal after leaving the psych ward. I was at a deep conflict. For about a month and a half I had been writing a suicide note to send to my family and friends after I finished myself, I was researching into painless suicide techniques. I had summarised information I looked into and kept it all private. At this point I realised I had failed and felt like giving up. 

&amp;#x200B;

All the things I had been through, all the failure I had felt. It was all that I knew. I had been depressed all my life this far, truly depressed. But because of the rage and feeling of intense failure I pushed myself to try one last time, with everything I had. I was getting bullied by ""friends"" for being angry and bitter in the moments I had shared a little frustration about things. I was being pressured for being weak even though I had been through so much pain already.  It was at this point that I started to let go of my ego completely. I re-definied love and the meaning of it in life. To truly love is to be selfless. Attachment is not love and we tend to get confused by it. If we are being attached and possesive we are being selfish. That is a fact. You can't expect anyone to do you any favours in life, you shouldn't expect people to go out of there way for you. That is desire, not love. Attachment is insecure, love is not. Now it wasn't this girl or relationship that did it to me. But it was what it represented, I had placed all my hopes in finding love to find happiness in life. This is a fallacy. As soon as I believed that I was bound to develop an insecure and unhealthy attachment to someone and that is not love. Because as soon as we are so afraid of losing them we lose our ability to love unconditionally. Once I had learn how I truly love by my closest friend at this time. I decided I needed to conquer the rest. 

&amp;#x200B;

I stopped communicating with friends and family for 4 weeks. In this 4 week period I spent every single day re-evaluating my research into depression and my knoweldge surrounding it. I've found that there are a lot of biases to the way people treat depression. For example: ""Excercise was my cure!"", ""this love of mine saved me"", or even ""video games and music"". Granted these helped people with their struggles, but I knew they weren't definitive answers to depression. I knew it was not only more complicated but had a simple answer. It had to right, there had to be one universal answer. Wrong I was. After compling my research I looked into the causes of depression and sifted them down to their roots. There is but one explanation for depression, it's a disorder of the mind but that doesn't clearly and preditively target all problems at once like an  effective anti-viral targeting all sides of the disease at the same time. So what was my answer. I realised it was 3 things: Situation (trauma), epigenetics (neuroplastic) and personality (cognitive-dissonance).

&amp;#x200B;

And if these are broken down it makes sense. It's either outsourced (out of body), epigenetic (genetic, and subconsciously programmed into the brain) or a congitive disorder of personality caused by conflicts of belief systems. 

&amp;#x200B;

I already had a fair understanding of CBT and DBT but then I looked into psychodynamic psychotherapy, something I hadn't recieved. 

&amp;#x200B;

More than often than not, people with depression are depressed because of something going wrong with their life (no shit). But there's a lot of people who say that you can't understand their depression, well I'd like to say I CAN. When trauma gets so deeply rooted into who we are and we unconsciously preset the world with a negative emotional association we get more negative experiences regardless of currently conscious beliefs. Meaning we will feel depressed even when we don't think we should simply because we have felt depressed before which so much background conditioning causing us to be the way we are. The subconscious mind is responsible for the largest porition of all your decision making and emotional emission. Humans are habitual creates and while we do have influence over our actions we don't have total influence. We will feel the way we do because we have felt this way before. The last influence over depression is personality. I'm sure there are many people out there who believe they are perfect the way they are and this might be true as an imperfect perfection kind of thing but we have disorders of thought because we have disorders of belief systems. Psychodynamic psychotherapy and CBT are probably the best ways to analyse poor belief systems but I  determined my own way. I used the 'Big 5' personality traits , ""Extraversion (associated with positive emotion), Neuroticism (negative emotion), Agreeableness (the primary dimension of care for others), Conscientiousness (associated with duty, precision and responsibility) and Openness (interest in ideas and aesthetics)"". And I also used my core beliefs to analyse what mattered most to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I started with a good personality evalation from this website.  [https://www.understandmyself.com/](https://www.understandmyself.com/) and then I wrote down what mattered to me most individually.  [https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/\~/media/CCI/Consumer%20Modules/Back%20from%20The%20Bluez/Back%20from%20the%20Bluez%20-%2008%20-%20Core%20Beliefs.pdf](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/CCI/Consumer%20Modules/Back%20from%20The%20Bluez/Back%20from%20the%20Bluez%20-%2008%20-%20Core%20Beliefs.pdf) 

&amp;#x200B;

My list started out like this, (top 3 most important, last 3 in no particular order):

&amp;#x200B;

1. Love
2. Family
3. Strength 
4. Happiness
5. Sponteneity/Freedom/(Impulsivity) &lt;------- part of the problem  (not a problem in itself)
6. Success &lt;------- part of the problem (not a problem in itself)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And then I checked my personality traits 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Extraversion (20% ish)
2. Neuroticism (75%) (epigenetic conditioning)
3. Agreeableness (45% around there)
4. Conscientiousness (5%) (expentionally low) &lt;---------------- part of the problem  (not a problem in itself)
5. Openess (65% ish) 

&amp;#x200B;

What I found when I looked into these is that I had a strong conflict between my perception of what it meant to be successful and my natural and unconscious desire to be impulsive and spontaeous. These two strongly conflicted with each other. Because I unconsciously desired to be succesful but also was chronically disorganised I felt shame built up overtime as I failed to do the things I wanted to do well successfully. But because I had the conflicting belief of spontaneity and freedom because of this it caused me the consistently fuck up. This created a shame complex. Which is what caused my depression as a kid. Failing if felt sometimes can be bad but it's not nearly as bad as feeling it all the time. And this was a circusmtance of my reality. Now you could simply go about trying to redefine success and give up on it, but in my circumstance I valued success as part and parcel of what defines happiness. To live life is to do it not only being happy but to live it fully. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately if you do not believe you can be helped you won't try to be helped, you won't believe anything. And that is the first part you must get past.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not that I still don't feel depressed from time to time, I do, but it's like a 30 minute experience opposed to a constant feeling of being lost and actually depressed. Depression is like any other experienced emotion for long enough. It can and will pentrate into our lives, it has to be trained out of our conscious experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

What did I miss?....

&amp;#x200B;

Psychosomatic pain. Pain disorders unrelated to genuine physiological damaged and even those that are somewhat related. This is a deep field and I could talk about and explain this for a long time. But It's not worth it so I'll summarise. The nervous system can be conditioned to recognise specific stimuli as irritating or painful as a defence mechanism to damage. We're build to avoid damage so the brain can develop a hypersensitivity to literally anything felt by the nervous system or connected to it.  IBS, tendon, muscular, etc. It can be very difficult to train out any kind of hypersensitivity in the nervous system but also dangerous. What if for example we misconceive pain that is genuine with that which is just created by nerves and tension. This is why testing is essential in part of this process. But also if I were to describe it, it's like an itch that increases in tightness and prevalence the more we engage in consciously being aware of it. In order for us to train it out of a state of hypersensitivity we must slowly and gradually expose the area to stimulation. I was instructed and consulted by physiotherapists and psycholigists on this matter. Pain doesn't = damage necessarily. We can develop thresholds and pain is a way of the nervous system letting us know that we're coming to the point of damage. We can condition our bodies to not only strengthen physiologically (within fair circumstances) but to also not feel pain as much as we used to, to the point of hardly noticing things. But it involves pain. How I did it in the simplest explanation is by gently ignoring my pain every time I felt it while I was using a particular body part and then taking a break and repeating the cycle. Use, ignore, move on, use, ignore, move on, be tough. I recommend you to see a good physiotherapist to guide you though this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anxiety...

&amp;#x200B;

Can't be fixed easily either. I've talked for a while, but to be honest the only way I solved this was with gradual exposure and letting myself feel anxiety without trying to stop it every time it happened. I only grows in sensitivity with resistance. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's all, I'm open to anyone teaching me something I don't already know.

&amp;#x200B;

I did spent an obessive amount of years looking into all this information, whether or not you want to believe them. When it comes down to it there's a lot to change then that. I have learnt a great deal with it comes to communicating properly with people and still are which has a influence of its own on happiness, but it definitely doesn't control my existence like it used to. I am always learning, but now I know why I am the way that I am in, I'd like to think.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to clarify something, no one single disorder here can be cured completely. And at any point in anyone lives they can suffer from anxiety, depression and pain. But there is a huge difference between these disorders being a consistent experience controlling our lives and them being a normal emotion experienced by any particular person at any paritcular time. They can be eradicated to the point of general and positive emotion to even the point of greater control then a regular person. Try or die, isn't that what being human is about.

209,I haven't been on this account in a year and I'm in such a better place,"I made this account as a depression account because I didn't want my main account clogged up with my dad and fucked up copes. And there were some things I was ashamed of and of anyone I knew found my main Reddit, I didn't want them seeing this stuff. 

I posted quite a bit a year ago because I was in such a bad place. I was drinking and partying way too much. I was stuck on the time I had a stranger on Craigslist rape me. I never admitted this on this account because I didn't admit it to myself but I was completely in love with my gay best friend. 

Reading some of my old posts and comments, it's like a whole different person. I barely remember writing them. I'm still depressed, don't get me wrong, but I feel like I've matured so much over the past year. 

So despite my flaws and hangups and breakdowns that I promise you still happen a lot, here's some things that are better:

I lost 30lbs

I studied abroad in Greece 

I feel I've come to terms with and accepted the Craigslist event

I've stopped having hookups 

I've focused a lot more on school and done really well 

I reconnected with a friend

I'm no longer in love with my gay friend and we've had lots of necessary distance and plan to reconnect next week, where I will meet his new boyfriend

I haven't been clubbing since November. Last time I went to a club last week, I volunteered as DD and still had a fun time 

I haven't said ""I need a drink"" since September 

I cut out a toxic person from my life

I applied for a really good job and might get it 

I've found out how much I love hiking and nature 

I have some new favorite songs 

I got some really nice and comfy shoes 

I graduate college on Saturday 

I had a heartfelt conversation with a friend about depression and suicidal thoughts 

I've smiled and it hasn't felt forced 

My drunk friend took a candid secret photo of me and commented on how genuine and happy I looked in it

I can feel empathy and be interested in other people 

Sometimes I just smile to myself for no reason 

I've been interested in TV shows

I haven't wanted to self-harm since November 

It snowed this year and I built a snowman 

After a long time of feeling like I was only pretending to be nice, it's starting to feel more natural to say nice things about people 

I have a lot of money on animal crossing and I have friends who let me visit their towns 

----

That's all I can think of for now, but I hope I can find lots more to add onto the list as I live my life. Overall, even though I'm sad, I feel like the world is beautiful and life is worth living, even though my future is uncertain and I don't know who will be in my life in the coming days. I've cried a lot these last few days, but getting on this account and seeing how far I've come, it's a light in the darkness.",51,bk5ekv,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bk5ekv/i_havent_been_on_this_account_in_a_year_and_im_in/,2019-05-03

Because then they can pretend I have enough control over my situation to actually improve it, which justifies their attempts to make me continue living.

236,"I don't want to die, I just want to be released from my suffering","The worse I get, the more that the idea of death enters my mind. I've been getting so much worse, I don't even know how I'm not somehow dead yet. Every time I have to move my brain feels like it's going to implode, I'm hit with a giant wave of nausea, my legs are fighting to keep me upright and keep moving, and even if I just move a little bit, it feels like I've just completed a marathon. My thoughts also won't leave me alone. I'm constantly reminded of how much pain I'm in, how it seems to never go away, how utterly useless I am, and how absolutely nobody cares about me. If I don't have to get up to do something, I spend all day in bed either crying, laying despondent in complete silence, or trying to sleep the pain away. The light is always piercing my brain and I often don't even bother turning the lights on. 

I just want to escape from this. I'm continually haunted by the idea that I *could* have a successful future with no pain, a pleasant job, and people who care about me - but I can't completely convince myself that it IS possible. In all of my years on this Earth, nobody has shown care for me. Nobody walks up to me to start conversations, nobody wishes to know me better, and nobody cares about my state of being. Even my own parents are totally unwilling to help me in the simplest ways without me begging them for *weeks*. Most of the time I already feel dead. I make no dent in anyone's life and I'm incapable of living. I wish I could gain the confidence needed to finally end this. I have been fighting for so long just to survive and, now that things are way worse, I just can't keep fighting. I need to take responsibility for my suffering and find a way to end it, as councilling and medication isn't seeming to be working. 

God, why did I even have to exist in the first place? Suffering 24/7 does not feel worth fighting for. I'm sick of having an average of 5 panic attacks every day. I'm sick of waking up in the middle of the night crying hysterically unable to breathe. I'm sick of being unable to function in everyday life because I constantly feel like my entire body is decaying. I'm asking for help. I'm reaching out to the people who are meant to care about me to say 'I can't handle this on my own and I need assistance'  but nobody is listening to me. When I tell somebody that I am struggling, I don't want their answer to be 'you have no idea how hard things have been for *me'.* I feel like I should be able to handle this on my own and I'm completely failing at doing so. I feel selfish for feeling like I require help from other people. Why would they help me? I seem to provide no function in their life and my suffering doesn't seem to affect them. I'm failing so much at doing this whole 'surviving' thing and I can't seem to pick myself up.",85,bke81z,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bke81z/i_dont_want_to_die_i_just_want_to_be_released/,2019-05-03
237,Does anybody else feel like a ghost that everyone can see?,"Feeling like a ghost that everybody can see makes me sad and angry. I would rather want to be a real ghost instead just to escape all the sorrow that I feel. For example  
I had a birthday last year, and nobody ever congratulated me when they knew I had a birthday. Then when somebody actually congratulated me, everyone started to do so. I think a lot, so it made me think that they congratulated me because somebody else did it and that they wouldn't ruin their own ego or make it seem like they are a nice bunch. Then recently my friend which I know for quite some time now, had an upcoming birthday next week. He of course invited me, but I heard people say ""oooh guys, let's not forget his upcoming birthday"". I took both of my hands and placed them on my forehead. I closed my eyes and began feeling so much silent rage coming from myself, and I was thinking that i'm a ghost, I was beside them as well, but they didn't even bother to ask me if I was feeling good because I had my both hands on my head seeming I was sad or frustrated, I even kept my my hands on my forehead for like 10 minutes or so that my elbows began hurting. I was really jealous of my friend I think, because I never heard people that I got along with say that to me and because I never once heard that being said to me in my entire life, so I never knew the pleasure.

238,lost a good friend/crush,"4 months ago, I started talking with a really nice and sweet guy in class, he sits in front of me. We are very similar, actually. The problem was and still is, his depression and anxiety. He texted me almost every day something about school stuff, we talked about random, but not too personal things...I accidentally found his reddit profile and read his problems. I cried while reading. It was really bad. Some things were really disgusting and sad. So, I decided to tell him that I know everything. Big mistake. Actually, I couldn't deal with knowing all these things and be quite. I care about him, a lot. He feels lonely, sad, tired, was bullied a few times, some health problems, suicide, dying, lost friends, social anxiety etc. I told him that he is not alone, he can always talk to me, that I really cared for him... He was angry and embarrassed, I understand that. Talk didn't last long. He told me that he is trying to solve his problems. He hugged me at the end. After that we didn't speak, he can't look me in the eye, same with me. I lost him. All I want was give him help and support. But I destroyed all. I don't want to be pain in the neck, but I want to fix this mess. I know he cared for me in some way, not sure if it's friendship or more for him, but now its all gone. how am I supposed to fix my relationship with him? and yeah I dont get easily attached, but when I do, fucked me up completely. please help, I want him back, because I realized that I really love him.

240,"If YOU feel shitty, help SOMEONE ELSE not feel shitty.","Kinda shitty advice. But I'll start with some backstory. I'm on mobile so forgive me. (This will be kinda rambly)
I was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after I checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but I always felt as I grew up that something was wrong. When I went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when I was 18 things started to click with me that I needed to figure out a way to find meaning. It didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. So overall I kinda suck at being a person.(still do)
Anyways, I've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit I didn't really understand. Because of this I turned to weed and alcohol when I was 15. Went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub).
Again anyways because of the plant I kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy functioning member of society, but it was only a sense. A taste of what its like to kinda face things with some objective stoicism. A new perspective. But its a fading remedy, a bandaid. It doesn't address the core of the problem.
Well, new years eve 2018 I get arrested for an ounce of pot and a gram of shrooms. As I stood there with those cuffs on I couldnt help but think ""damn, cant catch a break.."" That was a low point, sitting in that cell. In my own cell with anklets as if I were the most dangerous person in there. Statistically speaking I kinda was, at least the type of person most frequently shot by police, a mentally ill colored man mid 20s. But I just wanted to feel better. For the past 15 years constantly thinking of the relief dying would be. Those thoughts popped right back into my head with my ass on that cold bench. How nice it would be to not be a burden to my dad. I'm tired of feeling that way and to this day I feel that way. 
But... A human life doesnt last that long and I know one day ill die anyways. Its the only thing promised when you're born is that you'll die. So I observe those thoughts and counter them with the former. ""I wanna die. -you will."" So how do I make this time count if none of it really matters. What do I do with this big cosmic joke of an existence?
I make it worth it for my dad. 
We struggle. Sometimes we dont know how we'll pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. And all of it together makes me wanna opt out. But then I think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living HELL that would be. Even if I cant do much, ill do what I can till I can't. Because if I dont that would make me sadder than anything I can ever encounter in my life.
My point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. While feeling EVERYTHING. And its heart breaking. My dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says I don't belong on this earth.  The least I can do is gtfo bed and try to do SOMETHING. Even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. So that he can see a good looking smile that he made. To make HIM feel just a little better. That's my part, my mission. Thats what gets me up. There are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them.

244,I paid off my car today two years early!,"I've been struggling with depression and suicide pretty badly for the last few years. Didn't work for about four months, lost my girlfriend, friends, went into pretty bad debt. Took to the bottle to cope and made things worse.

BUT - I've been sober about 3 months, I've been exercising and reconnecting with old friends, pushing out the depression and boredom by occupying my time with productive side work and other activities. I'm back on my feet and climbing out of the depression and debt, and I managed to pay off the rest of my car today a couple of years early! Now I can start putting that money towards my other debt and keep moving forward.

I just wanted to share the good news and let people know that are struggling, things can change and get better. I know I certainly never thought they could, and tried to find extreme ways out of feeling that way because it didn't seem there would be any other solutions. It takes a lot of time and hard work, and in some cases medication, but it can be done. Don't give up! Keep fighting and moving forward, even if you can't get out of bed in the morning and it feels like nothing matters, keep doing it. Even if the only thing you do in a day is get up and get out of bed, you've accomplished something. Try taking it one step farther and making your bed. Shower every day. Exercise once a week. The small victories have really helped me work towards bigger goals and I spend far less time stuck in my head wondering, ""Why bother?"".

Happy Friday everyone! Good luck and best wishes to all of you. You're beautiful and important, even if you can't believe it right now. If I did it, then so can you.",138,bkfuwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bkfuwt/i_paid_off_my_car_today_two_years_early/,2019-05-04

Yea. Like that's the reason ur life sucks and you do nothing all day instead of accomplishing literally anything. I legitimately managed to smoke myself into such a stupor that I forgot what I was running away from...

Dumbass. You smoke because you hate yourself. Because if you sit with nothing but your thoughts for more than a minute the sheer weight of your accumulated self loathing would flatten an elephant.

249,"Depression is the hot funny meme until you're not sleeping, not eating, and hoping you'll die in a car accident","I never understood why so many people see depression as something we can all joke about so fucking carelessly and casually. Like, it's funny and relatable to see tweets and memes about how much depression sucks but it really does so much harm than good, doesn't it? I can't understand how this is just so commonplace. 

I laugh at them. Theyre funny. I see myself in them. And then for hours and days upon days I lock myself in my car with a vague numbness, ditching class or calling off work to just... what, stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot, chew through a pack of cigarettes, and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions. I stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of who's looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn. 

I don't sleep for days on end until I collapse. I lose weight in 7 pound intervals. The thoughts of being a fuck-up and how bad I would beat the shit out of myself if I met myself on the street just stew any time Im beside myself. It's so funny! So quirky and relatable! If this is relatable that's fucking tragic. Being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something I want everyone to laugh at with me. 

It's three am here and I'm just having a cigarette in an empty bathroom tub because I don't wanna think about anything. I wish there was a way to turn brains off. Medications haven't worked and I don't like being medicated at all anyway. It feels like hitting a plaster wall anytime I try to feel anything.

251,Never hesitate to ask if somebody is okay.,"Today, I was walking home from my daily exercise (it was around sunset time), and I saw a man who looked to be in his late 20s, sitting alone under a gazebo with his head down on the table. At first I was too shy to go over to approach him, so I lied down on one of those circular spider web swings that was nearby and pretended to browse my phone so that I could build up the courage to ask him what's wrong. I suddenly noticed that he had gotten up and was about to leave, so I quickly jumped off the swing, caught up to him and said, ""Are you okay?"" He turned around and the poor guy looked like he was on the verge of tears.

""You look down, is there anything you want to talk about?"" I asked. He stopped for a moment, then explained to me how his dad had passed this week, he was great friends with him and from the looks of things he had been depressed ever since. I offered him my condolences and put my hand on his shoulder to comfort him, and I told him how my dad is always busy with work and I don't get to spend quality time with him very often, so it was good thing that he was good friends with his. I tried to brighten up the mood so I changed the topic to something casual and we talked for a good minute or two. I even picked up on his peculiar accent and he told me he was from Mexico (We don't have a lot of Mexicans in Australia so it was kind of cool for me!) Anyway, I closed the conversation by smiling and wishing him the best of luck, and we both left on a good note.

Please, if you ever see that anybody is sad or lonely, don't hesitate to ask them what's wrong. That person will look back and remember you for it, and probably wish that they could see you again so that they can thank you. And I guarantee that you will feel a great sense of pride for yourself too.

If you're reading this René then best wishes from me, and to all you guys too. Good luck :)

253,Getting better feels strange,"I have good news. I'm slowly getting better. I've had chronic depression for over five years and recently I've just had to fight and put things into perspective. I've also made a new friend who has been through similar hardships, and we've been able to help each other too.

However, getting better just feels strange. I suppose this makes sense as I've been pretty miserable for years now (save a few stretches of time where I did feel better temporarily). When your entire outlook and mood shifts, it's natural to feel uncomfortable. But the big thing is that I feel *guilty* about getting better. I don't know why. Depression rarely makes sense, and part of it is the fact that I don't love myself and oftentimes believe I deserve misery and pain. So for me to get better and acknowledge that I do deserve love and happiness makes me feel guilty I suppose.

Additionally, one of my biggest fears about getting better is that my support network will abandon me. I'm not going to lie, it feels good to get attention, and there's no shortage of that when you're depressed. People will line up to help you out and talk to you when you're miserable. A very selfish part of me wonders if the same people will give a shit if I get better.

I don't know. I want to get better, of course, but a sick, twisted part of me wonders if I even deserve it. It's a lot to take in all at once.",50,bkl2ok,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bkl2ok/getting_better_feels_strange/,2019-05-04

This has caused me to believe that my problems dont matter making it possible to ever share anything with my parents. I really think im going crazy at times...
 
dont get my started on my family- its a toxic mess, mom dad fight all the fucking time for dumb shit, same with my mom and brother.......and my mom is nice..too nice for her own good and my brother and dad often take advantage of that fact and treat her like shit...Fucking hell, just writing all this is giving me an headache

273,Does anyone else hate when other people look at them?,"I'm a 35 year old male and I lost my job back in October. I've been on unemployment and I live alone. I go days sometimes weeks at a time without actually speaking to another human and when I do it's usually just a cashier at the grocery store. No real conversation.

Anyways, I take long walks everyday just to get out of my apartment and to ease my boredom and depression.  Most of my walking is on a trail that goes through the woods and I feel fine when I'm in there but it's about a mile walk from my apartment to the start of the trail in the woods. 

While I'm walking down the regular neighborhood streets I've noticed that I've been getting irrationally angry when cars drive past me. I feel like the people in the cars are staring at me and I hate it. I do not look back at them at all. I don't want to. I don't want to see anybody. I just want to be left alone. I start to get irritated after a while because as soon as one car finally passes me, another one shows up right after it and I feel tense the whole time that I am in view of the passing car. It's like I can't relax until I feel that I am not being seen by anyone and I get angry at the cars, like they are doing it on purpose to me or something. I hope I'm making sense and you guys understand what I am saying...

I also feel irritated when I see someone walking in my direction going the opposite way. I grit my teeth and just stare ahead until we finally pass each other.  And if I feel like they are trying to make eye contact with me as they pass to say hello or whatever, I feel even more upset.  I know it is irrational behavior.  I feel like "" well I'm not being rude and staring at you, so why are you being rude and staring at me?""

I end up getting home from my walks feeling more stressed out and irritated then I was before I even left the house. 

I think ultimately it is a self esteem issue. I feel that people are staring at me because I seem odd or like a loser to them or something. I feel like people must think that I am an alcoholic or drug addict because why would a full grown man be walking around the streets in the middle of the work day? Why is he not in a car? Again, I know it is an irrational feeling. I don't even know if they even are looking at me, I just feel it and I hate it. And since I know that I hate when people look at me, I feel that I am being polite by not staring at them and I feel like everyone else is being rude to me and I get angry.

Am I the only one in here that has this issue?",69,bkrfbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bkrfbq/does_anyone_else_hate_when_other_people_look_at/,2019-05-04
274,"I don’t want to die, I just don’t want to exist.","I was doing so well for a while. I had finally started to get over my ex, my friends and I were doing great, my home life was great. Everything was perfect the way it was. I was so excited to move out soon. Then something flipped the switch.

I made the mistake of trying to talk to my ex again. Maybe I should have listened to my friends after all. Now I can’t get him out of my brain, even in sleep. My home life turned to absolute garbage. My friends always make excuses not to hang out with me. I’ve been laying in bed for the past six days. I want to leave but I’m scared to move. 

I’ve taken up smoking cigarettes again to cope with the pain. Sometimes I burn my arms or slice my legs. My medicine no longer helps. All I want is to feel both numbness and emotion. It’s like I’m numb but my heart hurts all the time. 

Recently I posted a picture on r/amiugly. Maybe it would make me feel better about myself. Even with all the sweet messages and comments it didn’t help. I still feel huge. I still feel disgusting. I’ve only been eating around 500-800 calories a day. Other than that I have a hard time keeping food down. I’m not throwing up on purpose, the food just won’t stay inside of me. 

I don’t know how much longer I can take this. My body hurts, my heart hurts, everything hurts. I don’t want to die but I wish my mother would have aborted me. I wish I wasn’t conceived. No one likes me. I try so hard but there’s just something wrong about me. 

I wish I knew what was wrong with me. I wish I knew why I make my stepdad so mad, I wish I knew why people don’t want me. I don’t know if I did something wrong. How am I supposed to fix it if no one tells me what I did? Everything hurts.

282,"My Post graduation depression, sorry its so long I don't expect anyone to read it, it's more for some self counselling lol","Graduated uni a couple months ago and those last few weeks were hell, before that I honestly was the happiest I've ever been in my whole life, I had recently gotten into a dance crew and was chosen as one of the performance team members, I was on an internship on a TV series. Everyday I had something to look forward to..... Then my hand in time came for my final assignment, our performances ended, I got an extension because of my internship. I was trying to live in my happiness that I neglected my assignment... which triggered my depression, which has really been a constant since growing up. 

I was spiriling downwards, my full packed schedule of rehearsals that ran till 3am, filled with laughter and hard work was gone. Without these distractions my feelings of gender dysphoria came back (I'm female but have always struggled with my gender identity), I cut my hair but honestly it made me feel even worse. I began counselling and got a further extension for my assignments, which led to me having to embarrassingly tell one of my lecturers face to face that I was having mental health issues.

I then isolated myself to get my assignment done, but most of it was procrastinating, then feeling terrible because I was procrastinating, then stressing out because I didn't have enough time, then feeling horrible because I had to get a second extension and lie to everyone about why I got it. My friends graduated without me because I still had my extension, so I had to graduate a couple months after. I had put on so much weight during the month my friend's hadn't seen me between graduation, that I heard a few people talking about it as I passed and I could tell how shocked my friends were at my appearance because of little comments they made concerned about my health, which I just smiled and joked about.

My 21st birthday was the day before my assignment was due to be handed in, I hadn't slept for 4 days and I honestly forgot it was my birthday. I was sitting in front of my laptop sobbing, as I'd just had just self harmed, when I looked up and saw it was 12am... it was my birthday. That day my mum, sister and cousin had a surprise for me in the kitchen, balloons and a cake and presents, I wanted to cry, but held it in and faked a smile because they had put so much effort and I felt so bad that I didn't genuinely feel happy. They took so many photos and videos of me that day, as they sang happy birthday, but didn't post any because of how terrible I looked, besides my mum, she didn't give a fuck lol.

Once I finally handed in my assignment I thought I would be happy, but oh was I wrong. The first time I looked in the mirror after just over 1 month I couldn't recognise my appearance, I had put on 15 kgs and my eczema had gotten so bad. So here I am currently, 5 months later, I've put on another a couple of kgs, I'm working now, but besides that my passion for dancing has completely disappeared and I've put my position in my crew on hold because of ""health issues"" , I've completely isolated myself from my friends. And besides work all I do is sleep on my off days, unable to fall asleep during my working days, and eat and game. 

I tried seeing a counsellor again, it helped, but I can't push myself to leave my house unless necessary. I hate myself so much, everyone thinks I'm just antisocial and lazy, but everything is just so exhausting, even showering or getting out of bed. My family joke about how I'm a cold, unfeeling person, it makes me feel better that they can't see my pain, but some nights I just wish someone would hold me and tell me everything will be okay. The only real emotion I ever feel these days is sadness, besides the numbness. Whenever I'm not at work I can't stop thinking about suicide, how I'd do it, everything, I can't count how many times I've googled it.... my mum's the only thing keeping me alive and the disappointment I see on her face everyday is crushing. I wish I wasn't such a failure.

I suffered childhood abuse, mentally and physically. 
And since have depression, PTSD and some OCD in later life.

I'm trying very hard to identify my 'unhealthy' coping mechanisms, conscious and subconscious:

1. Internet addiction, social media in particular and article-reading
2. Staying in bed a lot
3. Binge watching TV series/documentaries
4. Disassociation
5. Distrust of people, keeping them at arm's length as getting close to them causes anxiety and a feeling that I lack control
6. Wanting to get tasks done as quickly and efficiently as possible, mainly so I can get home and be alone in bed
7. Moving around a lot, travelling, quitting and starting jobs... not sure of the reason for this, maybe as a stimulant? To make myself feel alive?",123,bkxymd,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bkxymd/what_are_some_of_your_unhealthy_coping_mechanisms/,2019-05-05

Not **EXACTLY** like that, but very similar. Basically, a few years ago they were a depressed recluse with social anxiety and no social life and suicidal thoughts, and now they're super social with many connections, and have new passions, and are overall much happier.

How far can you distance yourself from your mental illnesses? At what point do you *become* your mental illness?  How do you move on from your depression after you start doing better?

 

This may be a long read, but I really needed to vent, or at least write this down. 

I come from a largely religious and conservative family. I have different perspectives and I'm not at all religious, which I have to keep secret and is a great source of guilt. Otherwise, my family are loving and supportive. They don't really understand depression, or think ""people get it, but not in our family!"" so I was depressed all throughout high school without getting any help. 

Then, I finally got to go to college. I left my hometown and came here to the US for school. Finally got therapy. I was diagnosed with major depression. Therapy was bad. They gave me anti-depressants which made me even more suicidal. I would disassociate for weeks. Nothing felt real - I was stuck in a state of solipsism for a whole semester. I couldn't make friends because it all felt fake. I either felt like people around me didn't actually exist or that I was dreaming. One day, I took too many anxiety meds, and I started seeing faces on the wall. The next morning, I felt crazy. I couldn't even comprehend that I had taken that many and I felt like if I kept going on the meds, I would end up ending it all. So as a desperate act, I quit both meds, and stopped going to therapy. It was stupid and reckless. The withdrawal was worse; I failed a whole semester, and distanced myself from the few friends I made. 

After the summer I magically got better. I really thought, ""finally! Now that my depression is gone, I'll be okay. I'll pass my classes, make friends, and all will be well."" Yet nothing changed. I'm still fucking up. I feel okay, I'm putting more effort in school and socializing, yet I failed another class, dropped the other, couldn't get into any friendships since this is sophomore year and everybody has their ""clique"" already and the only two friends I have are transferring. I will have nobody left. I come into class and leave without talking to anybody. If I get sick, I have no idea who to call. I'm so incredibly lonely in here. I know I should be better. I could make friends. I could put even more effort in my academics... but I keep fucking up. I'm starting to feel like I'm the problem - not my mental illness, not my anxiety - I'm just lazy, spoiled, not smart enough, or bad at socializing... and I should take responsibility for it rather than live in the shadow of my depression and blame it for everything. 

Reddit, I don't know how I should move forward from here. I'm panicking as I write this; I feel like I'm the cause of all my problems and I'm the reason why I'm so god damn lonely and miserable, yet I don't know what to do, and I really hate myself for it. I know I shouldn't, and that self hatred is irrational - but I can't help it.

313,It kind of makes me angry how people on Reddit outside of this sub are so inconsiderate towards depressed people.,"Like if you make a post about being depressed on a default sub-reddit, or an otherwise ""normal"" sub-reddit such as /r/teenagers or /r/AskMen or /r/AskWomen or /r/gaming or /r/football or /r/writing or /r/smashbros or /r/breakingbad or /r/funny or /r/aww or just any other sub-reddit outside of this one really, people will just shower you with downvotes, accuse you of being thirsty for pity or craving attention, or just straight up mock you in the comment section till your post is removed. 

&amp;#x200B;

And it's kind of scary, too, because that's basically how the world views depression outside of depressed people like us ourselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

I mean I get that I might be posting things in inappropriate or un-related places, hence the negative reactions, but depressed people aren't always going to be thinking 100% logically in the first place, and I think people could at least be more sensitive that accuse me of wanting pity for them, or mocking me to my face. 

&amp;#x200B;

One guy in one of those subs, I don't remember exactly the one, said, *""If you could stop being so fucking depressed all the time, and you could take your chances to improve your life and be happy like a fucking normal person, then things wouldn't be so bad, would it? So you deserve all that's coming to you. Your depression, your lack of friends and a social life, and the ass beating that would come your way if you dared share all this depression with the others around you in real life. Some depressed neckbeard you are, when others out there actually have legit problems.""*

I sense what's going on. ""Er... mild depression.""

This happens a lot between me and older adults. My dad had pretty much the same reaction. I don't get it. Does being a young adult mean I can't suffer? Sure, I don't have a house, kids, a job; but that's the whole thing—that I'll never get to have house/kids/stable job in my life.

I went to a park by my house I always made an excuse not to go to and I sat in a chair, stared out into the bay and thought. Thought for hours about what I just did, why I did it. Sitting there I was more at peace than I have been in what seems like decades. Which is weird bc I’m only 28.

349,I disappointed everyone that expected great things from me,"When I was attending high school, i was top of my class with a dream of attending an ivy league university, particularly MIT. All my teachers were extremely proud of me. My parents were excited for my future in education. My peers thought highly of me. However, once the middle of my junior year came, i was faced with an overwhelming mental breakdown and fell into a depression.

I would spend sleepless nights doing schoolwork with already unstable mental health or i would do completely nothing and think. I eventually started to think about why i am doing this and realized that i dont like this traditional route im going on, nor will the results of it make me happy as i am already depressed doing the things i should like doing.

at that moment, my life lost its meaning. near the end of my junior year into senior, i stopped taking care of myself, developed insomnia (due to my obligation to try and keep up with my AP classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering), and slept in all my classes. 

my teachers, parents, and peers as a result started looking down at me, wondering why i became such a ""disappointment"" according to my principal when i wanted to lighten my workload. this put me in the deepest depression of my life as i felt i failed everyone and destined to be nothing. 

i would resort to cutting myself, drinking, taking old prescription pills, and withhold from eating as a way to ""punish"" myself. 

to make this short, i decided to make my main way of attaining happiness is music. that is my dream. everyone is still disappointed in me and it weighs heavy on me. i wish it could go away.

356,No connections,"Does anyone else feel like they haven’t made a genuine connection with someone ever? I feel like I have the ideal happy life, decent job, good car, decent health, but the main thing that is killing me day in and day out is never having a single person that puts me at the top of their list. It’s like a thing now, everyone is so hurt by past traumas or parental issues that anytime I bring this up people freak out about how they’ve been burned in the past and will never allow it to happen again. 

This, in turn, causes me to slowly morph who I am into what people need at the time. Whether it be stern advice, a shoulder to cry, a friend to vent to, a brother to depend on. And each time when I hope that it will be reciprocated people show me (or in some cases tell me) that they have someone else they need to put first.

382,Consume the REAL world. It helped me. At least for a day.,"(I wrote this note for myself but then modified it to post on Reddit because someone somewhere might feel helped by this, like I got helped).


This is a quick note before I sleep. I can't not record this. It's very important. I hope you (the future me) would read this when in need and pay heed to this advice/experience.


I have been feeling very very low and depressed since the last 7-8 days. Hopeless. Scared. Worried. About future. About meeting with XYZ (Not having done any work, having wasted all these days spent lying in bed doing nothing), about XYZ (which is less than 2 months away and I've done absolutely nothing at all till now), about no one to talk to about feeling like this, the feeling that nobody in the world cares about me. The feeling that I'm all alone in my sadness. Very intense feelings. Some moments I faced, while still in bed, were probably some of the worst of all the feelings I've felt because of being alone.


So the point is, today after breaking down and feeling like I have lost control over my life, cursing and screaming everyone I know who does not care enough about me to ask me how I'm doing, somehow I managed to get up from the bed, get clothed, wear shoes, telling myself that ""mobile phone is not the real world"" (I had been spending all my active time with my mobile phone, no human interaction), and the phrase that I had read somewhere on Reddit, ""don't forget to consume the world"", and go out of my room (finally after 11 days). I didn't know where I was going, I just went. Out. Of. My. Apartment. I didn't care what anybody thought about my clothes, my face (I'm not native to where I'm living and people can see me and tell this), my shoes, my hair, my eyes, my way of walking, my weak looking body, my anything. I didn't want to be self conscious at least for the time being. I stopped thinking about myself - you know those continuous debilitating thoughts we have about ourselves. 


I walked around and thought that maybe I should go eat something in a restaurant. Luckily it was 3pm and few people were there (I feel conscious of going to restaurants becsuse I feel there are so many people there and they would look at me judging my each move - pro tip, they won't). I ordered my favorite dish and waited while looking outside from a window at people walking by and around. It was like television, except it was real. The real world. Super fat people. Super thin people. Super sexy looking people. Sick people. Old. Children. Dogs. People sitting by themselves. People sitting in groups. People looking at other people. People busy in their mobiles. 


And suddenly I felt that it's okay. It is alright. It is fine. To be yourself. To be by yourself. The world is made up of different kinds of people. It is fine to be you. You be you. There is no perfect person. Even if there is, you don't have to be that person. It is okay to strive to be that person, but please don't let that image of the perfect person push you into inaction, feeling stuck, feeling low of yourself. It is alright to not be that perfect person. You're good and fine just as you are. Nobody thinks any less of you. It's alright for people to see you and judge you as imperfect. It is okay. You do not have to be ""right"" at everything. It is okay to be wrong. After I had food, I walked about some more, went to a museum. Spent 2 quality hours in there, all by myself. 


Even though I didn't talk to anyone, after spending all this time outside in the real world, I started feeling good. And happy, even. Just because I was outside in the real world consuming the real things, away from my mobile phone. I didn't talk to any friend, I didn't have any meaningful conversation with anyone other than telling the waiter my order and asking directions from the museum-person. 


TLDR: if you're feeling depressed and stuck in your room/mind, and lonely and alone, no friends, scared hopeless and worried, get out of bed and force yourself out of your apartment/room and take a walk, sit somewhere on a bench. Whatever happens then, will not be anywhere near as bad as what you were feeling lying in the bed.",27,bm26gn,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bm26gn/consume_the_real_world_it_helped_me_at_least_for/,2019-05-08

I’m telling myself I don’t want to live, having anxiety that I’m bothering people, losing interest in my hobbies, can’t think as straight, and whenever I give myself a break, all I can think about is how much of a lazy piece of garbage I am. A friend I asked out rejected me, and while I respect her decision, I often think about her and while she says we’re still friends, she doesn’t talk to me anymore. My depression is preventing me from enjoying things and I just wish it would go away. The only therapist I have right now is my school counselor until the end of this month, when I MIGHT finally get a new one. I’m honestly just confused and it’s hard to just wake up in the morning.

422,Open letter to my son,"To my beautiful boy. My sweet, sweet little man. 

I’m sorry I’m not the best mum. I’m sorry I get so distracted. I’m sorry that sometimes my head is too cloudy to give you my all. I am really trying. This isn’t anything how I pictured parenthood being. I am struggling to keep up with the image of being ok 24/7. Just know that I love you. I stay alive for you. I keep myself in my place for you. Because I’m your mama. 
Sometimes I feel like I don’t deserve you. Sometimes I feel like I’m doing the worst job. Sometimes I feel like I’ve failed you. I want to sing songs to you. I want to talk to you. I want to do all of these things that mother and sons do together. Sometimes I struggle to eat a full meal and I feel guilty that I don’t have plenty of milk to feed you properly. You cry. I feel ashamed. I feel like I’ve let you down. I wake up thinking “I don’t want to get out of bed today” but I do, just for you. Because I love you. But why do I feel so hopeless? Why does my heart ache for you every single day? My baby, this is draining my soul. The anxiety I go through just to get money for us. Sitting in the office and having a series of attacks. Mummy is tired. Mummy is drained. Mummy wants to be happy just for you. I want to be all these things for you just so you feel whole. I didn’t want this for us. You don’t deserve to be put with a mum like me. I am a terrible mother but I’m trying my best for you. Postpartum depression is evil. It’s robbing my mind and it’s hurting mummy. I turn on my phone and it’s the only thing I’m glued to. I feel like the worlds worst mum. I feel guilty that I can’t even look you in the eyes sometimes just because of how bad I feel that you’re stuck with someone like me. You deserve better. My misery makes me forget to just hold you and give you a cuddle. Not paying enough attention brings me down even more. You’re a blessing. You’re the greatest gift that I’ve ever been given and I’m guilty because I’m not doing my job properly. I feel ungrateful. I love you so much, my honey. I feel so helpless because I have no one to talk to. I get told to get over it or stop being so sad and enjoy all of these moments. But it’s harder than it seems. I didn’t ask for this. I am trying my darling. I am trying so hard for you, you will see one day. I want to get help. But I’m afraid of being turned away. Afraid of people saying that it’s all my fault or that I’m just being stupid and emotional or to stop crying because trust me, I wish I could. Time is so precious and I’m wasting it by moping around. I’m wasting all this time to watch you grow by being distracted with my own thoughts. You are growing so fast. In the blink of an eye you’ve grown from size 0000 to 00 in just under 2 months. No matter what I am your mummy. I feel defeated and drained but I will always love you. I will always nurture you. I will always care for you. I feed you. I do everything for you despite my heart ache. I do all of my duties as a mother. I am strong just for you even though I ride through all of this pain. You keep me going. This isn’t a cry for help but just a reminder that I am trying my best to be strong. 

A mothers love is like no other. It’s true. Without you I probably wouldn’t even be here. You’ve taught me that no matter what I have been put in this world for a reason. To be your best friend. You deserve the entire world.

442,I really hate when people invalidate a depression diagnosis as someone being lazy and etc.,"""depression doesn't exist"" ""you just want to be special and quirky"" ""you stay in bed all day cause you're lazy"" ""most people diagnosed with depression don't even meet the diagnostic criteria"" ""why can't you just be happy?"" ""depression is just an excuse"" 

&amp;#x200B;

I think I've heard it all at this point. Really if depression doesn't exist, is that why I lay in bed all day starving myself? If depression doesn't exist, is that why I leave the duty that is showering at weeks at a time? I didn't realize being smelly was special and quirky.  If depression doesn't exist, is that why I won't leave my house? Do you honestly think laziness is the reason I was reported as a missing person to the police? If depression doesn't exist, why do I cry when I glance at myself in the mirror. Why am I isolating myself from family and friends? Why did I cut into my wrists? Why did I abuse substances, if depression didn't exist? 

&amp;#x200B;

An open letter to all those people out there saying ""just be happy"". That's cute. You've probably had a comfortable life, with parents who loved you. Unlike me, whose relationship with my parents has always been toxic. My dad first invalidated my diagnosis at 16 by saying depression didn't exist. He also threatened to kick me out onto the streets, and then again 2 years after that when my anorexia got worse. He just keeps me around cause I have some leftover money from school and he wants it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've come close to suicide a few times. Once when I was 16 and another time when I was 20. Recently it's been on mind, as I'm hitting new lows, but I don't think I could ever do it cause I'm just so in love with my boyfriend. Though, if he ever betrayed me who knows what I'd do.

448,10 things I learned in my fight against depression and anxiety. (Long post),"This is a very very long post, and I've managed to whittle down the most important things I've learned in my fight against depression &amp; anxiety. Do I have any credence to offer advice on this matter? Absolutely. Going from several suicide attempts to being happier, healthier and more focused than ever, I think it's only right I share what I've learned along the way.

Be warned however, that this is a long post, so go and put the kettle on and grab a snack before you sit down to read this.

Sharing is caring, so share the post, share the love, share your own stories, share your own techniques. Together, we can create a society that no longer gets depressed or anxious. Collectively we can learn, what it is to be happy, successful and empowered. So without further ado, here is...

----------------------------------------------------
**10 things to do to fight D&amp;A!**

1. Don't take life too seriously.

No matter what anybody says, life is a game. We come in with nothing, there are next to no consequences to our actions (on the grand scale of things) and we leave with nothing. So why do we experience so much anguish in between? Because we take it too seriously. When you play a video game, and it's just not going your way, it can be frustrating, you might even wonder why you're playing the game to begin with, but when you realise that the point is not to win, but just to have fun, then you can really bring out a lot more in that experience. Same goes for life. Don't beat yourself up if things don't go your way, don't get caught up on seemingly life-changing incidents. Life happens. Life goes. Regardless of what you do or how you do it, you'll be leaving the stage through the same door as the rest of us. Nothing changes that. So take a deep breath, chill out, and realise that everything will be okay. At this point people think it's an excuse to be nihilistic, to wallow in the absurdity that nothing really matters. But that's the wrong way to look at things. There are so many 'pointless' things we experience in our lives, and yet we still enjoy them. Same holds true for life.

----------------------------
2. STOP PEOPLE PLEASING

People always say ""you have to look out for #1 first"" and it took me years to figure out what that really meant. But basically it means 'Be you. If people don't like it. Fuck em!'

It's your life, and nobody has a right to tell you what to do, ever! (law permitting), so if somebody has a comment about what you do or how you do it, think about whether this person really needs to be in your life. I might get into cutting poisonous people out of your life in a different post. But seriously, all the energy you waste doing and not doing things to keep others happy is sapping energy that could be used to make you happy. You weren't born to appease other people. You were born to enjoy your life. So stop worrying about what others think and be you.

-------------------------------------
3. Accept it, you're human.

Humans make mistakes, and humans are also massively self-loathing. Not a good mix. So accept you make mistakes and move on. When you're depressed it's very very easy to be your own enemy, nobody is a worse critic than yourself. So when you do something that maybe didn't help you, learn from it. Ask yourself ""Okay, in hindsight that wasn't a good thing to do. What can I learn from this so I don't do it again?"" when you ask what you want to learn from a 'mistake' it's no longer that, it becomes a lesson. Somebody who keeps making 'lessons' is somebody who's improving. Why beat yourself up for learning? And i'll admit this is all easier said than done, but look at your idols, look at the people you admire, they make mistakes too - it's normal! So give yourself a break. Nobody is saying ""Oh look at them, they're really hard on themselves! That's so cool."" No. Nobody gives a shit. People have their own lives to worry about. So chill. Move on.

------------------------------------

4. Life's a beach, consciousness is eternal.

Now this one is subjective, but by our own experiences, we can say that consciousness breaks the first law of thermodynamics. That energy can never be created or destroyed, only transferred or changed from one form to another. But does consciousness really start and stop when life does? 

It doesn't really matter, but if we learn to create a belief system that facilitates a happier lifestyle, this concept of eternal consciousness may creep up. Imagine in 'the afterlife' that you have everything you could ever want. What happens? You get bored. You might decide that you're going to head to earth to have a human experience. You might decide to have a life with depression and anxiety to up the ante, like turning up the difficulty on a video game to make it more interesting. If we're abused at an early age, or brought into a difficult area to live, this can add context to that. We can say “I chose this so that life would be more interesting, I chose this to see what I could achieve. So why would I get upset about this? Just because I don't remember creating this life, doesn't mean I didn't do it.” With abuse, difficulty and anguish put in a larger context, it can take the power away from your trauma and put it back in your hands. This is your life remember.

What I want to stress at this stage though is that – for the skeptics amongst us- we don't get brownie points for being right if we're just going to kill ourselves. In this game, we get brownie points for being happy. If we develop a belief system like what I've just mentioned. We can learn to be happier, with trauma in a greater context, it has less power, with trauma in this context, it's just an epilogue that set the foundations for our own success.

------------------------------------

5. You are what you eat.

Diet really doesn't get the attention it deserves when people talk about D&amp;A. Think about it, you put food into your body, and the entity that is you runs on the stuff you put inside it. So why fill it full of shit? If you filled your car full of knock-off petrol you'd soon realise you aren't getting the performance you're used to. Same goes for people, we're not goats, we can't just eat whatever the fuck we want. Just because things are there, doesn't mean we should entice ourselves with them either. Get good food in you, get good fuel in you, to run the machine that is you, effectively. Pick fruit, pick whole foods, stay away from processed foods. But most importantly, remember number 3, sometimes life can get in the way and all we have time for is a McDonald's on the way home, that's fine, but don't make a habit of it. Respect yourself, respect your body, because you are what you eat, and if you fuel yourself with shit, your output will be shit too.

----------------------------------------

6. Exercise

Everybody knows that exercise is good for the fight against D&amp;A, but very few people partake in it. Why? Because they think it's painful. The pain of D&amp;A is less than the pain they'd experience from exercise, or so they perceive that to be the case. But there are many ways to exercise, there are many ways to get activity in your life. My favourite quote goes like with regards to exercise, “Even a walk around the block laps everybody on the couch.” and that's true! Nobody says you have to run a marathon straight away, if you warm up just to run to the end of your road and back guess what? You smashed it! The whole point is to do 'SOME' exercise, not do 'INTENTISIVE' exercise. As you begin to exercise more, you'll learn to draw the links between being happier and exercise, you'll realise that you think better after yoga, you work harder after a run, you have more energy to put into the hobbies that enliven you! 

And the best thing? There are so many ways to exercise. Don't want to be out of breath? Yoga. Can't run? Walk. Walking too boring for you? Get a bike. Only have a few minutes in your busy day? Well do some push ups.

There are exercise programs, techniques and philosophies to fill the ancient library of Alexandria a million times over – delve in, discover something you'll enjoy and experience that sensation of being able to accomplish amazing things with nothing but your body. You deserve that.

-------------------------------------------------

7. Meditate

Meditate. Marmite. Same thing? Maybe. Sitting down and doing nothing. Some people love it. Some people hate it. Some cultures revere it, some vilify it. But bottom line is, it's absolutely invaluable to people with D&amp;A. First thing to note, there are many ways to meditate, and there are many different pros &amp; cons to them. There are meditations for being a better fighter, or pianist, or athlete, there are meditations to become more empathetic, some to become more aware. We'll concentrate on one particular technique, the last one. Rather than go into why we're doing that, because I could write a whole book about it (and at some point will), I want to concentrate on how, specifically, meditation can help you if you're fighting D&amp;A. 

Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to meditate massively to get the benefits from it, and you don't want to do too much too soon because you'll end up stopping for reasons I can't be bothered getting into (Read 'The Willpower Instinct' if you want more info.)

Start with 5 minutes a day, sit down on a chair, close your eyes, no exotic poses, no visualisations for this one. Just breath in and out, in 1, out 2, in 3, out 4, etc... if you find yourself getting caught up in thoughts start again at one and keep going until the timer stops, it'll go off before you know it, believe me. Also, the goal of meditation is not to get to a super high number, the goal of meditation is to catch your thoughts and bring them back to a neutral point. So you don't 'win' once by not getting caught up in your thoughts, you 'win' every single time you realise you've gone off on a thought train.

So why bother meditating? Well for one, D&amp;A can take you on some pretty bad thought trains, when we learn to get off them, we can stop bad thought trains in (or on in this case) their tracks, giving us the opportunity to redirect them in a way to suit us. Also, after a period of meditation you'll just find yourself enjoying life more, I've always said that if I meditate on a morning, I just seem to have a better day. Who wouldn't want to have a better day all day for 5 minutes on a morning?

-------------------------------------

8. Affirmations for the nation

Affirmations, something you'll come up against a lot in self-help literature, but what exactly are they? Simply, a phrase that empowers you, a phrase to rewire your mind to a more happier state. The subconscious mind (the mind that controls the vast majority of our life) cannot differentiate between reality outside, and the information you feed it yourself. So, by affirming everyday “I am a happy, successful person.” your subconscious will take that as fact and begin to act out that reality through you – you will in turn become happier and more successful. 

-------------------------------------------

9. Intention

Intention is something that really isn't talked about when it comes to D&amp;A. But what exactly is it? 

Well you know on a morning, when you wake up, and there's a moment between when  you decide to get up and then actually get up? That's intention. During that time, you have the intention to get out of bed. Just like you can have the intention to go get food, or a job or get laid, you can set the intention to be happier. Intention can be used to overcome D&amp;A, simply by saying to yourself “I have the intention to overcome D&amp;A” and if you are progressively moving forward with habits and a lifestyle that facilitate a happier more healthier you – you are embodying this intention. 

So set the intent. Intend to be happier and healthier. Everything starts with intention.

----------------------------------------------------

10. Take responsibility

This is probably the hardest thing on this list, because by 'taking responsibility' for your actions, you also say “everything that has not gone my way so far in my life, is my fault.” and while that might seem like a hard truth, or even one you're not prepared to admit right now, doing this empowers you to make change.

Some people never learn to take responsibility for their actions, purely because we're not taught how. People say “Grow up!”, “Act your age!”, “Take responsibility for your actions!”. But what does that actually mean?

It means owning the problem, and I say owning because we may refuse to accept that we caused a problem, but that does not stop us from claiming ownership of it and fixing it.

So when you are confronted with problems in your life, when there are things in your life causing you distress, instead of saying “Why aren't others doing what I want them to?”, ask yourself “What can I do that will help me overcome this situation?”.

There are thousand of examples of taking responsibility that I may showcase in future posts, but by “owning a problem” you put yourself in charge to overcome it. Nobody is going to make you happy, only you can do that. So don't count on others to get you out of your own mess, it might seem harsh, but when you learn to empower yourself for your own problems, you become entirely self-sufficient, and you are never let down or dependant on others – you are not a slave to others, you are the master of your own life!",31,bmws39,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bmws39/10_things_i_learned_in_my_fight_against/,2019-05-10

452,Relationships just feel like work,"People around me make friendship seem so easy. They'll be chatting or texting or whatever and you can see that there is no effort on their part to keep the relationship going. I don't find it that simple.

I can tell that they aren't having a good time with me, or, if it's a group, that nobody would care if I was gone. And I have a hard time having fun when I know that I'm dragging everyone around me down. So just leaving, or not coming in the first place, is a win-win. It's not like I get invited places anyway. People tolerate me enough to let me come along, but I'm never asked to come.

I can't remember the last time I was able to interact with someone without it being taxing, and I end up dreading social events. I can feel myself becoming more and more distant, and the few people who like me are drifting further and further away. And I know that if I let this happen, things are only going to become worse. But I really, really don't want to keep trying if having friends is just going to be stressful.

461,"Everyone tells me to ""just do things that make you feel good"", but how does that even work if there is nothing that makes you feel good?","So, I've been through some rough times recently, no need to get into details. The people I talk to (family and just a few friends) tell me that I should focus on myself for a while, do things that I love, take the time to do things that are good for me, yadda yadda, you know the drill. 


And I just keep wondering - how the fuck am I supposed to do that? I have depression. I don't think I have felt genuine happiness in the past ten years. The only thing I enjoy is sleeping because it's basically a free trial of not existing. ""Take time to do things you enjoy"" - and how? 


I mean, I try to do things that I know are ""good"" for me. You know, eat healthily, lose weight, go outside, clean my apartment, all those things that functioning adults should be doing. But none of that makes me feel good. I lost 20lbs in the last two months and I feel nothing about it because guess what, I'm still a fat fuck and look like shit. I clean up my apartment and guess what, I am just as depressed in a clean room as I was in a messy one. 


It feels like I am just doing these things for others. To show them ""Look at me, I am okay and I am coping well"" when in reality, that's very far from the truth. 


I don't know how to deal with this. I'm tired. I'm tired of pretending to be okay.

7pm. I started by slicing my arm vertically. I was surprised by how difficult it was. It wasn’t just the pain, the razor got caught up on knots of flesh and Id have to slowly cut those away so I could get deeper. The amount of pain was too much once I got past the upper levels of tissue and into the fatty layer of my arm. So I cauterized the wound using a cigar torch and butter knife I stole from the UC. It wasn’t necessary, the bleeding wasn’t that bad, I just wanted it too hurt. I actually made the bleeding worse in all honestly. It ran down my arm and off my finger tips creating a pool of blood at my feet. I think I’ll always remember the smell of cooking flesh. My flesh.

9pm. I Bandaged it using a towel and procured whatever money I had to have my friend buy me liquor. He did, we said good night and that we’d see each other tomorrow. He looked worried for me but it didn’t matter. Not anymore. The blood had just begun to leak through my makeshift bandages as I got back to my dorm. I set about drinking as much of the handle as possible, watering it down for ease of drinking. 

10pm. Before the level of piss drunk I wrote a small note apologizing to the paramedics and whoever found my body. Beyond that I said nothing too my friends or family, I didn’t care what they thought anymore. The memory of my mother screaming at me for my depressed state still fresh in my mind. The memory of my fathers disappointed voice. The looks of worry on my friends faces. It didn’t matter.

No matter where I was I felt alone. No matter what I accomplished it felt meaningless. An A+ average was a sign of my stupidity if I wasn’t the top of my class. If I was doing well it was because I wasn’t trying hard enough. Nothing meant anything and everything meant nothing. 


12am. So I downed the rest of the cheap Mexican vodka, and with it all of my anti-psychotics, SSRIS, and whatever else was in my medical cabinet. I laid down in bed and cried. Through my tears whispering sorry over and over in the lowest voice I could as too not wake my roommate and RA. I wasn’t apologizing to anyone in particular, nor was I apologizing to myself. No one meant anything to me anymore, I was alone and I would die alone. I deserved to die alone. I deserved this. 

Then I woke up. 

4am. Serotonin syndrome has taken its affect, the room shifted unnaturally and my ears rung. I vomited into my sink over and over until there was nothing left but yellow bile. When I couldn’t throw that up my body kept trying anyway, causing my body to heave unnaturally. The pain was incredible, I curled into a ball on the bathroom tile begging for it too stop. I remember the tears pooling around my face most of all. I could see the reflection of my eyes in them, and past that the crusty maroon of dried blood on my arms. I wanted to stop, I wanted it to end. I laid there crying and dry heaving for hours.

7am. The pain subsides slightly, I check my phone. I have an appointment with my therapist in an hour. I stare at the notification for a long time before mustering up the strength to get up and change clothes. Putting on heavy deodorant to hide the smell of piss, blood, and vomit I leave the room and meet the day. 

I ended up in the mental hospital and the rest of my life began.

This was 2 years ago, and I don’t know why I wrote this. I think I just needed to finally share this with the anonymous masses. The scar on my arm is still apparent but it’s fading. Huge and jagged it reminds me of a person who hasn’t existed for a long time. The mental scares of my rape at the hands of my ex friend, the abuse I faced in school and at home. It doesn’t matter. It’s pointless to care.

I’ve grown to love the meaninglessness of it all, it’s all pointless and that’s comforting. That means I can be anything I want and not have to worry about it. If it’s all truly meaningless then we are free. Free of expectation, Free of worry, Free of doubt, just free. It’s scary sometimes but I get through it because I’m human. We struggle against the tide of meaninglessness, it’s our lot. But the things we can create and do that are good for others, make every moment worth it. Even if it is meaningless, I like it. Nihilism saved me.

Anyway to anyone who reads this far, know that you are important. You are and will always be the most important thing in your life.

 If you’re sad like I was, I know there’s nothing I can say that could help. Just know that no matter what, I empathize with you. I know what it’s like, to feel so alone. I know pain. I know sadness. In a way I know you too. I can’t help you like I’d want too, but I think about people like us all the time. 

I’m a nurse now and I’ve dedicated my life to helping those with our illness. I will work everyday and as hard as possible until I can truly help someone like us. I promise you that. My fellow humans are worth the effort. We are all worth the effort of being better. Good luck on your travels friends, I hope we can meet one day for drinks.

I used to be a social butterfly, had tons of friends. 

Some meaningful, but most were everyday shallow friendships. Then I got in a motorcycle accident and received an injury that was supposed to heal in 3 months that actually took 3 years. 2 of those years I couldn’t walk without some assistance. Pushed everyone besides my fiancé and some of my family out of my life, but it hasn’t been easy watching them watch me turn into this husk. 

Nowadays, I work from home as a choice because every time I’m around a new group of friends or coworkers I tend to fuck it up in fantastic fashion within a few weeks. I turn into this annoying goof that both takes everything literal yet constantly jokes around so sarcastically that they can’t tell if I’m joking or not. 

I’ve seemed to get a hold of my depression and and anxiety for the first time in a while. Meaning I’m not continuously getting worse, which I count as a win. It’s why I’m trying to go out more now. Gym, meditating, work at home is going better, blah blah. 

I know I won’t be able to have healthy relationships with people until I heal inside, but I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this? If you have, I’d love some tips.

No matter how many diets I start or exercise programs I sign up for, my depression always gets in the way. I'm almost 30 now, and I've spent more than half my life sabotaging myself. I'm sick of it.

So, yesterday, I decided enough was enough. I signed up for Talkspace (online messaging therapy, since I've cancelled multiple face to face therapy sessions) and I wrote a list of all my traumas and bad experiences to send to my therapist, explaining how they've impacted my life. It was...a lot. I have a tendency to say, ""It's not a big deal, I'm just a crybaby."" But seeing all the pain in my life written down like that -- no wonder I'm fucking miserable.

477,From my personal diary. I've never shared this with anyone before but I feel tricked and alone with my problems.,"  

  

**10/05/2019**

I’m angry at lots of things. And I want to sink into the ground. Like when I see someone, someone pretty. I think it’s something so far away from me. Another unattainable aspect of life. FUCK. I have few inaccurate words to describe this. Frustration is too shallow a word. I feel like I’m messing everything in my studies up. Yet I’m trying so hard and the studying has been torturing me without a break since December. Every day I wake up and my thought is – shit I need to work today. It’s just piling onto my personal life difficulties, and it’s too much.

What am I trying so hard for??? Where am I leading myself with this studying?! What’s the point if I’m going to feel this way regardless of my success?

I just feel so tricked and alone with my issues. Again, FUCK.

I need to memorise for this exam so much I don’t know how I’m going to do it. Even if I get a 1st in all my exams it’s not going to change anything. It’s not worth the life-sucking that is going on. FUCK.

I don’t know what would help me. In my fantasy of how everything would be if everything was ok, the actual core of change is me, not the things and people around me. It’s me having my life sorted out after which everything else comes.

So how do I sort my life out??? Do I need to start going what I actually want to doing? What would that be? All my energy is going into studying, so how can I abandon all the work that I’ve put in?

FUCK.

*And with that, back to revising… I want to die.*

***11.05.2019***

I don’t know what it is, but I just feel terrible. It’s not a single feeling that’s emanating from 1 source. It’s just a terrible, terrible pervasive shadow over me. Lots of negativity. Not respecting myself. Worrying that I’m a burden. Not taking care of myself physically. I want to sink into the ground and disappear. I don’t know if that means suicide, but I really do want to just vanish (for a bit?). Get rid of all this.

FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. FUCK.

I can’t keep on pretending that everything is fine when it’s not. I want people to know. But idk how to explain it to them. I don’t wanna ruin the moods of people. I wanna post it on facebook but people will think wrongly of my intentions, and too many people will see it. FUCK. I feel so stuck. I want to disappear, but I don't know if that involves dying or what. 

Is this depression? Or what is it? I feel like if I knew it were depression I’d have it easier, because I’d not be as confused and muddled.

This is a critical point for me. If I don't revise for this next exam, it'll be the first time that I'm not able to cope. I've been strong so far. But I can't see myself coping any longer. I'm desperate to get out but these walls are high and insurmountable.

481,Do you ever forget who you were?,"I hung out with a friend I hadn’t seen in years a few days ago. We were drinking wine out of cans and listening to music. And then a song came on, I song I once loved. “Come on! Dance with me, since when you are not the dancing queen?”. His question startled me for a minute, it sounded like something I would have said years ago. It made me think of that girl who I was before life decided to play some cruel joke on me. The girl that everyone loved to be around, so wild, so free, the girl everyone still thinks is there. A little broken, a little rusty, layered, but deep down still there. The girl who would get everyone else to dance with her, the one with the ballerina tattoo on her shoulder, always the first to dance at a wedding, always the dancing queen.  I thought of those videos of me dancing and singing as a little girl that my Dad had took. I used to feel so free doing it, like it was ingrained in me, part of my identity, I never understood the people who were afraid to dance. I don’t relate to that girl I once was anymore, she seems almost like a ghost. Just a memory of a person now. I don’t know really her anymore, she hasn’t been around in years. The new me doesn’t dance, she doesn’t smile, doesn’t sing while cleaning or cooking, doesn't skip down the street while walking. I don’t really know the ‘new me’ either. So who am I?  Or rather, who am I not?  I’m lost looking for myself. As if I'm outside of my body doing things I used to love, like I'm ***dead***.  It’s weird to think how alive I once was now that I don’t feel anything, so full of light and love and life. How beautiful, how sad. The fun one, always curious about something or someone, always traveling, always doing something new and exciting. This stranger in me now barely talks to even her friends, when she does it almost feels like a chore, always wondering why they stick around when I’m not me anymore. I still look like me, a little thinner now, but still my eyes, my freckles, my clothes. But can't they see it’s *no*t me? Do they not notice my voice, how it's gotten quieter, barely a whisper. “I can’t hear you.” I know! I know you can’t hear me, I can't even hear me. *But why can you still see me?* And why haven't you thrown a funeral for me yet? How do you even explain to the people who used to love you that the person they loved is dead? What would they say? What my therapist tells me, that it’s ok, I’ve been through a lot, that I'm still in shock, that one day I’ll be myself again. But it’s **not** ok, and I’m never going to be myself again, I might be someone else, but never myself. I'll never get to be *her* again. That girl DIED, it wasn't just him who died, it wasn't just a part of her that died, your friend is dead. She’s been dead for years now, she’s never coming back, and no one seems to notice. I get it, I know I've changed, that everyone just wants me to be ok again, to be ME again. Trust me, I want that just as much as you do. I loved that girl too, I miss her too.

The few messages I have received either so responding to me or turn out to be some kind of scam. I've been in medication, I've done therapy, nothing really helps. My own doctor doesn't even ask me to come to see her anymore.

So what is there left? When you're all alone all the time and the only people you converse with are online and may as well just be an imaginary friend.

Apparently, someone reported my comment and Twitter suspended my account, which I must formally appeal. Sending an auto generated email saying ""there are people out there that care about you"" seems like exactly the opposite of caring for me. After this happened, as I struggled to figure out the suspension, I had a mini panic attack thinking that I need to censor my own internal dialogue more when I share with people. Anyway, it just seems a BAD idea to isolate someone further when they speak out honestly about their own thoughts. And, to say that there is a right and wrong way to do that is hurtful.

497,I got my first A in a couple years after dropping classes every semester due to mental health issues/depression.,"Just telling you guys, it can get better. I dropped every class I tried for a few years. Wasted a couple thousands on tuition, always falling flat on my face and failing or withdrawing after the withdrawal date. I'd lose a couple weeks and then I'd just flunk the whole class.

I had a very understanding professor, but just finally got an A in my very demanding Japanese class. A few years ago I had written my suicide note and planned the location and method, and decided to give antidepressants a chance. They helped enough to keep me not suicidal, but not enough to not feel like i'd failed at life.

I just wanted to say... chin up, you guys. Be grateful for your little victories, even just making it through today. But there's light out there, even if it doesn't feel like it in your world right now. Mine didn't for a very long time. But for the first time in many years, I fucking did something that depression didn't take from me. I have a little more hope life can get better now.

498,I don’t care about anything anymore,"I’ve lost motivation to do everything and anything. I don’t even like to get out of bed anymore there’s no point.

499,Things I've noticed.,"One: Sometimes, I can't stand others. At times, nothing makes me feel angrier than seeing some happy couple. I get annoyed because other people exist. Despite this, most of the time I'm happy for those couples, most of the time I don't mind talking to people and going out too much. I can't stand the fact that I can change between those two mindsets within an hour.

Two: I can't stand myself. I think I'm ugly and refuse to accept the possibility that I'm not. I hate my voice (I have a speech impediment), I hate everything about me. I'm a coward, I'm a liar, I'm human trash and I'm legitimately surprised anyone looks up to me, cares about me, or at the very least tolerates me. I'm not special. I'm just another expendable and forgettable people in a sea of expendable and forgettable people.

Three: I am constantly caught between wanting to kill myself, not wanting to kill myself but wanting to die, and not wanting to die at all. These moods can and do change fairly regularly. It's annoying and idiotic.

Four: I'm hypocrite. I can't take the advice I give my friends and family. I hate how I refuse to try and help myself. I don't talk to people, because what's the point? Though I encourage people in my position to reach out to others. I generally ignore or say ""I'm fine, just tired"" when people check up on me. I know that staying up late, eating unhealthily, and laying around isn't good for me, but again, what's the point?

Five: I always think that normal things like giving yourself credit or talking about yourself is horrible and reprehensible (just for me, I don't think this for anyone else). Also, I always assume the worst will happen.For instance, right now I view my post as a narcissistic self-involved piece of trash, and I fully expect it to be removed or downvoted or people to be mean in the comments.

Why would any of you care? Y'all certainly have it worse than me. Sometimes I forget how nonsensical my ""problems"" are. A friend of mine told me I have no idea what real depression is like. She's right, you know. I've never self-harmed or anything, and despite all the bullying I received and all the fights me and my brother got in, and how I'm often blamed for things, I have a generally good life. The closest things to suicide or self harm I've ever done was stand on a bridge and try to convince myself to jump off and once I  picked up a loaded shotgun, just to put it down and take the shell out of the chamber.",22,bnlkge,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bnlkge/things_ive_noticed/,2019-05-12

507,My self-esteem is shattered beyond words.,"The more I think about my past, the more I realize how small things damaged me. Things that shouldn't bother anyone, let alone give them constant mental anguish for over a decade and counting. Yet, here I am, set off by small things from my childhood. There were bigger things that taught me that I am weak and that I will be used, taken from and abandoned. As a man, I don't say this often as I don't expect to be believed or met with much sympathy, but I had my first kiss stolen from me by a girl my age that I didn't like. She chased me every day until I gave up and she sexually groped and kissed me as long as she wanted. She eventually apologized years later but I guess that may be part of why I feel like I am destined to be taken from - to be the dirt under the nails of people stronger, better and more likeable than I will ever be. I saw an image recently of a lion devouring a baby zebra while it still had a membrane around it, fresh out of its mother's womb. If anything sums up my philosophy of the world, this is it. The strong take what they can, the weak suffer what they must.

All my life, people have told me that I'm the problem, and that I'm weird and unlikable. When I'm shy, I'm creepy and a downer, and when I'm confident I'm arrogant and a try-hard. I was always told I was spoiled, weird, thick, and that I should appreciate even the pain I feel. Even if these people are wrong, what does it matter? What's the point of being right when you'll be treated with contempt regardless?  And what if they are right? Even if they're wrong, life still seems unfathomably horrific. I feel so tired of being alive in a world where the only certainties are sufferance and death, especially as the worm that I was born as.",104,bnojuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bnojuf/my_selfesteem_is_shattered_beyond_words/,2019-05-12

I have two step moms. Sometimes I feel obligated to so something for them. It just feels wrong to me though. I wonder if they think I am a shitty step daughter for not doing so. I have all I can do to leave my house on this day, let alone celebrate a holiday with women who aren't my real mothers . I love them but there is just so much pressure in this.

513,Functioning with depression (yes I am still depressed but still get stuff done),"People around me do NOT understand my depression ( I'm in my mid twenties and have had depression for like a decade or more or something).

1. They do not understand that I have really low self esteem and keep telling me ""we see so much potential in you"" or ""you're not dumb"" when in reality I am (no kidding). They keep thinking I can do things that I can't.

2. They do not understand my hopelessness. Sometimes all I ever wish for is to make it through one day and most times I wish to die in my sleep. They do not understand that I didn't plan to live this long 

3. Mistake my depression for ungratefulness. Yes I am grateful that I have roof, shelter, and food but honestly sometimes it makes me feel worse that I have these things and not someone else. It makes me feel like I have wasted life resources and opportunities. I was given some privilege and opportunities and here I am depressed.

4. Sometimes I'm barely making it and honestly am just hoping to make it through the day. I honestly think about dying a lot and some days worse than others. Sometimes I think everything is pointless and I keep doing what I'm doing just to keep doing it. Best case it will lead me somewhere, worst case is its pointless and I already knew it.

5. I'm really grateful when they try to understand me. It's hard I get it, we all face our own demons and we can never completely understand how another person feels. But don't force your remedies on me. My sister thinks my depression is a joke. And says she also has depression sometimes. I don't judge her, but she treats mine like a joke. And she thinks I should just tough it out or whatever it is she does. It doesn't work that way.

6. I'm depressed and it's not like I choose to be. There are days when I'm not depressed and I try not to end up in the rabbit hole of depression, but sometimes it gets the best of me.its not like I'm not trying.

514,My sister is slowly running herself into the ground and pushing everyone away. Yesterday she went too far and now I think my family is about to have a huge melt down.,"     I have two sisters and my middle sister(26) believes she’s a “free spirit” and a “good vibes” only kinda girl, but I think she’s using it as an excuse to do drugs. She has always had a horrible attitude, problems with authority, and a down right bully. No one can say anything without her going straight into defensive mode where she will retaliate by ripping you apart with her words. 
    Yesterday was my college graduation. Friday me, my parents, two nieces, and middle sister all rode in the same car to my university thats three hours away. Tensions were already high because my sister had to go the whole time without smoking weed so she was in a rotten mood. Luckily we left late so she spent most of the time sleeping and went right to sleep when we got to the hotel. 
  Then it was Saturday, and shit hit the fan. My stepdad and I went to Walmart to get some last minute things. Later that day my mom told me what happened while we were gone. My sister was doing my eldest nieces hair and apparently she was giving her some attitude and my sister thought the way to handle it was to slap her across the face. My mom said that she didn’t see it but heard it and that she looked up from doing her own hair and asked “did you just hit ___” to which my sister replied “yea if she going to act like a little bitch and not listen I’ll slap her in the face”. My mom was in shock and didn’t know how to react, she talked to my niece who said that she didn’t want to tell her mom(probably out of the fear that it would cause a shit ton of problems)
  Then it was time for my graduation and I could see from where I was sitting my sister waited for me to be called then left to find a place to smoke the blunt she had stashed. After the ceremony was over we were staring our long drive back home and my sister kept cussing and my stepdad is super country and religious, he had kept quiet for as long as he could and finally said “I’m gonna take some soap to your mouth” and that set her off she put on her most hateful look and said “I say whatever I want and you can’t tell me what to do. I’m grown and can do whatever I want” and they kept going back and forth then my sister told him to stop talking, put her headphone in and ignored everyone. Then she started gathering up her stuff in the car taking about how she was just going to get out and I said “don’t do that it’s not safe(we’re three hours away from our home town)” and she turned on me telling me not to tell her what to do and I was like I’m not I’m just saying it not safe. Then we spent the whole three hours in silence.
  My mom eventually told my oldest sister what happened and she’s pissed(woke up to a text from her this morning). Now I’m just sitting here waiting for the moment everything blows up and I just feel like crying and throwing up. My middle sister had always been like this, but she went too far and I’m not ready for my family to go into full blown war and hate each other. Oh and my sister is apparently cheating on her husband who is working out of state.

519,Just want everything to end .. ... 25F,"I have majorly screwed up my life. Some background I graduated with my masters degree in Speech Pathology in Decemeber AND got engaged. I was going to be married in September. I took a job I didn't really want 6 hours away from all my family and friends to be with my fiance. He had lost his job from which I found out he stole prescription drugs from. His Mom picked out our apartment which really bothered me. I was really struggling at work, I was the fifth therapist in a school that year (should have been a MAJOR red flag), my supervisor was basically not around at all. Anyways I totally lost it I had a total mental breakdown and up and quit my job because of it and left my fiance. Things were not going well in the relationship which also stressed me out. 

So... leads me to my next problem. After like a month at home not working I took a job in a rural SNF (nursing home) 5 hours away from my family, although I have an Uncle nearby I'll be living with for a while. I am beginning to really regret my decision and just want to stay home; however, I don't want to jeopardize my career any further since I already up and left a job. 

I am desperately missing my ex fiance and keep blaming myself for the end of the relationship (though he had his own issues too!) I just can't get over it and I'm scared I'll fall apart again away from my support network. The job itself seems better than what I had and is good money in a low cost of living area. I'll be able to pay off a lot of debt. 

Problem is I've been wanting to just end it all lately. I find it so difficult to be positive and feel just petrified and unmotivated to do anything. I feel like stone, I can't find it to be happy at all. I just regret all my decisions. I just want everything to end.

528,Teachers never seem to care.,"Teachers don’t seem to care at all.

Everyone at school fails a test, one kid turns in his homework late, someone doesn’t do their work so they can salvage a bit of their mental health. Suddenly everyone is trash. I hear the same things everyday: “None of you seemed to care, so I’m not going to give any of you another chance,” “You slacked off on this didn’t you?”
 It’s painful. While not every kid is depressed, my school seems to have no awareness for depression. I’ve slaved in all advanced classes since elementary and I’ve finally lost it. I barely do work because even thinking of it makes me suicidal. But my teachers don’t care. 

 One teacher yelled at me for not following the rules EXACTLY on a group project. I got extremely upset. Usually I hold in my emotions (because if you cry or yell the school immediately punished you for disturbing the class), but when I can’t I usually hit myself for reasons even I don’t know. I asked my friend (who is a girl) to hold my left hand down (I always use this hand, for some reason I never do it with my right hand). I asked her out loud right after my teacher yelled at me. My friend immediately held my arm and rubbed it to try and make me feel better. My teacher just said jokingly, “You’re ready to just flip everything off the table.” She said it in a joking tone, not even even seeming to care. I just told her that I “Wasn’t going to tell her.” She just walked off like it wasn’t her damn problem. I nearly lost it and just stared into space while my friends looked at me with sad yet caring expressions.",30,bnvr0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bnvr0t/teachers_never_seem_to_care/,2019-05-12

532,"Wanted to post this here because right now, I am beating depression!!! I want to share this story.","I was on the verge of killing myself in the fall. I hated my job, my life, and myself. I got into my 1st relationship ever also in the fall. It wasn’t good or healthy, but I liked having a companion as it was something I’ve never really had. She broke up with me because of my depression - which I do not fault her for at all. I was destroyed. I lost myself with her. This persuaded me to go see a therapist for like the 8th time.

I’ve never had luck with therapists, but I gave this one a shot because I was at rock bottom. 

She changed my life. 

I never wanted to take medicine, and I told her how adamant I was about this. She didn’t force anything on me, something I’d never had before. She listened. She helped me set goals, no matter how tiny they were. She described it as “we’re just stretching.” I never felt pressured with her and I actually began to look forward going to her. Something I thought would never work amazingly was actually working! She helped me with positive self talk - which has been amazingly helpful to me. Unfortunately, something with my insurance changed and I was unable to afford seeing her anymore. But I didn’t lose myself, and I’m unbelievably proud of myself for it. 

I’ve kept grinding. I’ve had plenty of bad days since, but I’ve been able to bounce back more frequently. 

People around me have noticed a difference, I’m much more happy and confident. I still have suicidal thoughts, but I’m able to thwart them most of the time. I feel I have more control over my mind.

I’ve been eating better, working out more, showering more frequently, and engaging in positive self talk. I mutter to myself, “I’m the best” multiple times throughout the day. Positive self talk has helped me tremendously. 

I wanted to share this because I hope someone will see it and see a glimmer of hope somewhere. I know my circumstances won’t fit everyone, but sometimes seeing someone in a similar boat doing well can help give you hope.

Right now, I really don't want to die. I just want the pain of becoming an adult to stop. I want the pain of work anxiety to stop. I want the pain of financial worry to stop. But somehow, my brain defaults to suicidal ideation. It assumes that I can't ever stop the pain without death, and that shouldn't be. As a result, I feel like I'll only be a benefit to people if I just disappear rather than truck through the anxiety and depression to work sloppily.

544,I hate waking up.,"There is a moment. 

                              A moment where I haven't remembered the bad things
 yet.
When I fist wake up from a deep sleep. I am cozy in my bed and comfortable. The morning light and the sound of little chirping birds come through my window.   Sometimes i remember the smell of coffee at Grammys on one or another holiday. Golden rod and ham for breakfast. I could stay here forever.

 I can usually manage for a few minutes if I'm lucky.

Eventually it breaks. This fragile memory.
The flood begins anew. So the pain washes over me.

Grief renews its clutches on my heart.
               ""Remember, silly girl , they are all DEAD. HAHA their holes will never be filled with anything but pain, sorrow and regret"" Continuing a path of those lost and more to lose. The permanence of never hearing their voices or to feel their touch again. 

The emotional scars barely healing, ripped off. I remember that I hate myself.  That everyone you thought liked you has turned their backs. Ignoring you. Wishing you would disappear. Every nasty word. Every person who took advantage.  All the lies. The betrayals. The decite. I don't know where these wounds are hidden inside but they hurt and are never fully healed. 

Reassurance from loneliness that I am incapable of being loved. Or being a priority to anyone. He is the quickest to hold me down.  I feel the overwhelming weight of him. I can't breath. I can't think.   I can only feel. ""They'll hurt you more,  just stay away. They won't actually love you.  Just wants to use you. "" They will always leave. Even the ones who are ""always"" there never really are.

Now life  Jostles you. Daily struggle to pay bills with no money,  physical pain you have to deal with.  Mental pain. Work. School. Relationships. Should you do this or that.  Where to go. What do I do. 

I hate waking up.  I hate getting out if bed. 

The pain is intensified after the moment.

I get one moment. No matter how bittersweet. I get one moment to forget.

They never pay you enough to escape because then they’d have to do the work to replace you (which they could easily btw) so you’re forced to kiss ass the entire time and go through fake interviews where you pretend to give a fuck what a stranger thinks of you that are super nerve wrecking. So in order to not starve to death in the streets you’re basically throwing your “gift of life” down the drain every fucking day just to not be an outcast.

Nothing brings joy, I'm always expecting the worst, *because I know how my day will be*. I don't even have a place to rest and wallow in sadness.

559,29 years ago I tried to kill myself but failed,"29 years ago today (which fell on Mother's Day) I took a massive overdose to end my life after my family went to church. I felt like such a failure as a human and parent (still do) that my only choice was to die to stop the pain. I ended up in ICU for three days, followed by 90 day commitment to the state mental hospital where they told me I just wanted attention and mocked me. They stopped after I told them I hadn't discussed a plan with anyone, I had not talked about killing myself, and after I took the overdose I did not call for help. They finally realized I wanted to die and stopped trying to ""help"" altogether. Then I discovered I was pregnant while in the mental hospital, so my plan to jump in front of a passing train wasn't going to happen.

569,"Is anyone else growing tired of this sick, fucked up world?","My depression has improved recently, almost to the point that I can say it doesn’t have an adverse effect on my life. But as my self hatred and sadness go, I notice more about the world I live in. 

There’s so much inequality, poverty, rape, death, sadness, pestilence etc in this world and it makes me feel sick to my stomach. A majority of the rich just sit back and watch as we destroy our planet like fat glutinous pigs. 

Sometimes my girl-friends will show me the messages they get from guys on Instagram and some of the stuff they receive is absolutely vile - and these people walk among us like normal ordinary citizens. It makes me wonder what other people walk past me and I don’t bat an eyelid, a murderer? A rapist? A paedophile? 

Even on a smaller note, my girlfriend and I broke up two months ago, she got raped two weeks after this. It was really, really hard for me and I can only imagine how she felt. It put me back into a depressive episode but I came out of it. But all the while some of the people I consider friends gossiped and created rumours about her that weren’t true and you wouldn’t believe how horrible they were to her. Since I found out I’ve stopped associating with the “friends” in question. 

I find it hard to stay motivated and to want to live in this world when it’s filled with horrible people who do horrible things. I have such a negative outlook on life and I can’t even blame myself for it. I blame the world around me, I blame the people around me sometimes I wish I was dead just so I didn’t have to live in this place.

Loneliness drives me to connection, and makes me put to much into them working out, even if they’re not that serious. It makes me overthink every little thing and makes me so mad at the world I could just scream “Why do you do this?!” 

Others are like this, I know, but the need for love is what drives it away. I hate that.

578,I have an invisible handicap.,"I am clinging on to a failing life. 

I am passing time until my parents die and I can end my own life.

I am lying to everyone. How could I be honest with anyone about this hopelessness?

How could anyone accept it? Keep up polite conversation? Want to be around me?

I have no power to change myself.

I am smart, capable, bright, and driven, but depression rarely lets that shine through.

The person I am when not depressed is incredible. But that person is rarely present.

I am not a 20 year old who is doing bad in school, got dumped and is ""hopeless.""

I am a fully grown adult who has been depressed their entire life.

I know that I will never be free. 

Everyone around me is hopeful. 

I put on a good facade, helped by a cocktail of psych meds.

Drugs let me get through the day crying less. 

But they don't solve anything.

And they ruin my quality of life

No energy, no sex drive, no life.

Decades of this makes me hopeless for change.

I'm in therapy, and have virtually every resource.

But I am broken.

I have an invisible handicap.

On the outside, it looks like I should win at life.

People around me express hope for me.

And why wouldn't they - many people find relief from depression. 

But I have no hope. How could I after decades of depression.

I have love in my life. I am on a path that someone else could do very well on.

I can see a perfect future for myself.

But I can't maintain. 

I can't get there.

I can't win against depression. 

No drugs (illicit or prescribed) help.

No therapist, friend or family, however loving, can understand or help.

I have love and people around me but I am alone with depression. 

If I had been depressed for only a year, or a few years, maybe I would still have hope.

But looking back at my decades of struggles, I can't entertain the irrationality of hope.

I will have positive times in the future. Good days, good weekends.

But overall, I will never feel good about life. The most I can hope for is a brief escape of a happy day. 

Not enough to make life worth living. 

I wish things were different. Life could be amazing. I could do so well. 

All I can do is pretend to smile when I'm around others.",93,bojwpb,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bojwpb/i_have_an_invisible_handicap/,2019-05-14

580,People saw me cying at school,"A few weeks ago my depression was horrible. All I had the energy to do was basic hygiene, walk my dog and show up to class. I could barely sleep, clean my room or focus on my schoolwork. I stopped showing up to my service learning hours at school too due to depression. Service learning involved working with children with disabilities which took too much of a toll on me emotionally. 

I already left a class that only meets once a week. So I knew I couldn't miss another class even though I was depressed. I cried before class that day. I didn't cry during class but I was holding it in so much. Finally class was over. Some girl I didn't know approached in the hallway and asked if I was okay. I said no, nervously laughed and walked away.

Honestly that made me feel worse. I left the building and then sobbed uncontrollably. Some other guy asked me if I was okay but I kept sobbing and walking, ignoring him. One of my classmates saw me and talked to me. She talked to me, telling me everything was going to be okay, blah blah. She told me I could talk to her and asked for my phone number so I could talk to her after I told her I had no friends at school.

No, she never texted me and I still don't have many real friends except for one of my classmates.

Im posting this because I feel most people don't understand depression. Not everyone in university is shallow but I overhear conversations about hookups and parties at the library a lot. I used to have some friends at university but I realize most were relationships of convenience because they don't want to talk to me when I reach out to them after they graduated. 

Or maybe people do understand depression and just don't care. I feel like people ask, ""are you okay?"" so that you're forced to say something along the lines of ""I'm fine"" because it makes asker feel better.

583,Pretty sure I’m about to be homeless,"I hate work so god damn much. There is no feeling that brings me so much agony, like the feeling of waking up and realizing I’m about to spend the next 8 hours of my day doing shit I do not want to be doing. I have lost every job I’ve ever had because of this reason alone, and it’s the #1 cause of my depression. Welp I did it again. My old job I got fired from for calling in sick too many days gave me a second chance. 3 days. I worked 3 days before I called it quits again. The feeling of being in a place you don’t want to be, and having to be there for an elongated period of time is suicide inducing. I almost broke down right then and there. But I didn’t. Instead, I walked out in the middle of my shift on my 3rd day and almost ended it all. But fuck I don’t have the balls. Welp, here I am. 63$ in my account, rent due in 2 weeks, pg&amp;e due in a couple days, and no desire to look for any more work. It truly feels like death is the only answer. Because if to function in this society we’re required to either work, or go to school, and I absolutely hate both of those things with a burning passion.. then I don’t think I’m bound to be a part of this society. The only other option is to get lucky, and blow up randomly for doing the thing you love. However I’ve just come to the conclusion that I’ll never get lucky. I’ve been making music for over 10 years, consider myself quite talented at it, and it’s never gone anywhere. So either I’m actually bad, or am just not lucky. Unfortunately I don’t have the balls to actually commit suicide.. so it looks like I’m about to be homeless. Hey maybe while I’m on the street a car will hit me, or something. Anything to end the constant suffering of knowing what’s required of me in this life I do not want to participate in. God if I didn’t have to work or go to school life would be fucking perfect. If only I got handed the royal flush in this sick twisted game of poker we call life.

Tonight, after a particularly rough evening, I wrote a suicide note. It was a relief. I said everything I wanted to say, told the people I loved it wasn’t their fault, that sometimes things just break and we can’t fix them.

590,"After years of this I just feel numb. I'm not sad, I'm not happy. I just am.","My only friends are my parents, and I can barely stand them.  Just had a fight with mom and she uninvited me to go to my grandfather's funeral and said if I wanted to go I'd have to find a way to go myself.  She knows I can't afford it, even if I just drove, even if I just slept in my car for the 6 days of driving.  I wasn't really looking forward to being in the car with her for that long anyways, but it's the only way I can go.  


I used to be suicidal. Still am I suppose.  A few years ago I ate probably a thousand pills.  Roommate found me; I didn't tell the hospital my parents contact info.  I guess I'm lucky.  Back then I wasn't afraid of death.  Now I am, oddly, but the depression is still there.  I never thought that'd change in me.  I never thought that the reasons I had for my morals would change and I'd keep the morals but for different reasons.


One night not too long ago something just clicked, I'm not sure what caused it or why I hadn't ever really considered things that way before.  I just realized that death is final, that... There may not be literally anything, at all, after this life.  That once you're dead you're dead.  Forever.  This is it, it's all I have.  And that it's all anybody has, human or otherwise.  That even a bug, with it's limited consciousness, thats all it's got, once it's gone it'll *never* exist again, in any form whatsoever.  But before that, there was still that hope.  So I've been thinking about that a lot.  About how it's just like going to sleep and never waking up.  And now I'm sitting in my bed, night after night, terrified of actually going to sleep. 


I want to kill myself, I'm just too afraid.  I still have a shred of respect left for the being that I am, like literally just the matter I'm made out of, and the effort that was put into my existence by people other than me.  Like it's not my right.  I'm subscribed to Answers With Joe, love the guy, and he recently had a video about Buckminster Fuller.  Fuller was on the brink, and almost killed himself when, according to him, he heard a voice that told him ""You do not belong to you. You do not have the right to eliminate yourself"" - or something like that.  I had never heard that before or who that man was, but it struck me as a little fucked up.  It doesn't make sense, and if it's true, then that's fucked up.  It kinda cheered me up temporarily because it allowed the fantasy of thinking there's something watching over us, even if that something is malevolent and considers us property.

It was hard and I am still not in the greatest place but I can feel I am starting to love life again.  I can feel I am going back to how I was but healthier!

To all the people who told me I couldn't be a doctor because I'm too unstable and unreliable and I let my emotions spill over into other aspects of my life to the point where I can never become a professional: you were right.

596,My suicide has been stolen from me.,"I've had suicidal ideation since I was a teenager and still do to this day. I regularly fantasize about suicide. My brother commit suicide when he was 19 and I was there when my parents found out. I feel as though I could never go through with it because I wouldn't want to do that to my parents twice. In a way I feel like it is unfair because my brother took that away from me. He was a beautiful person inside and out, and I'm not, it's not fair. My brother was incredibly intelligent, good looking, and a caring person. I wish he was still alive because of that and because that would mean I could be dead in his place. I don't feel like a failure, but I'm disgusted with who I am. Does anyone else deal with the existential limbo of a desire for suicide and the fear of it's finality? I dread the idea of becoming older and older with that feeling being unchanged. But I know it won't change. At my job I work with a lot of kids who suffer from mood disorders, and it hurts me to tell them that that feeling never goes away, you just get better at managing it.

Early 40s, male, depression, anxiety, ect, my entire life.  Managed to isolate myself or otherwise destroy every single relationship ever.  Family, friends, women, whatever.  Always lonely and wanting, but manage to fuck up everything anyway.  I was an honors student in high school, never had to try to get good grades.  Made it thru 2 semesters at a good college before bottoming out.  Floated thru life for years with no path, just surviving, miserable. Managed to find a girl with similar issues and woo her somehow.  .  Now, after 16 years together, 13 married, one child, she leaves me, too.  I am now completely alone again, no family or friends to turn to, a shit job I took just to pay the bills, debt thanks to the wife and my incompetence.  I live alone in  a big house I cant afford, have my son 50% of the time, but its only a matter of time til i fuck up that relationship, too.  I just started therapy and seeing a psychiatrist, too, but that will end as soon as the ex takes me off her work's insurance, but I don't see that helping right now either.  I was prescribed some anti depression meds, but the insurance co rejected it, and the pills cost over $1000 for a 3 month supply without, so thats not happening.  I have nothing in my life to look foreward to, nothing that makes me happy anymore, no one to even talk to about it.  Honestly trying to find a reason not to just end it, but I would never bring myself to do that either.  I know i have to stay alive for my son, I don't want to do anything else to fuck him up more, but that doesn't seem like enough.

I shower every day before work, wash my hair, get dressed in a shirt and tie, and nobody seems to know how bad I'm feeling every day. Most mornings I wonder for a while if i could just not go, turn off my phone and give up, it's always in my power to end it. If i failed I'd be in a much worse spot though. Maybe im still holding on to hope that there's a better life in my future, but it seems so distant that I'd never make it. 

I keep up appearances, but I'm certainly not taking care of myself. I don't exercise, i eat one, sometimes two meals a day that consist of junk food, don't brush my teeth often. Every day im afraid that today will be the one i start experiencing health problems that i can't just ignore that will send me into a spiral. I can't even keep up with the maintenance on my car that i worked for years to get, let alone my own problems.

I don't talk to anyone about this. I brought up with my roommate that I'm not happy, but he just says stuff like ""things aren't that bad for you"". I haven't seen my brothers baby that was born months ago. I didn't visit my mom on mother's day. Im pushing everybody away because they just don't get it. How could they? Everything looks fine.

I am a social person, a mix of an introvert and learned extrovert. People can see the depression in me, but I always thought of the effect mildly. 

Now I have learned about the subtle effect of depression, I realise the many encounters where I thought I had some confidence, communication, or relational issues. 

I just realised this, but I cannot comprehend the whole picture as it spans way back in my life.  I am trying to seek support in understanding this issue.

613,My cat saved my life and is currently the only thing keeping me alive,"I found my [cat](http://imgur.com/gallery/PaIduAK) by pur dumb luck. I was sad and looking at the local shelter cats to cheer me up. I fell in love with him immediately because we both shared severe anxiety. I begged and begged my mum to get him but, alas, she said no.

After a couple of weeks I gave up. 

Things got worse, a lot worse. I was in class planning my suicide for that night, writing out drafts. When all of a sudden I get a text saying something like ""get out of school quickly, we're going to see that cat you want, the shelter closes at 4 so you have to run""

I was so excited about this cat, I loved him even more in person and because of my excitement I didn't kill myself that night. 

I'm 95% if it wasnt for him I would've followed through.

We quickly bonded, and because of his bad anxiety to this day I'm the only one he really trusts.

So many times over the couple of times I've had him I've been close to just offing myself but I couldn't bring myself to do it, because who would look after him?

Tonight things got bad, extremely bad. I was sobbing loudly which is unusual because I'm usually great at concealing my tears. I was again planning to kill myself but everytime I thought of killing myself I would think about leaving him and my crying would get heavier.

He shows up at my door screaming and I let him in and he twirled around me and purred and I immediately calmed down. He may have spent the entire time in my room trying to eat my rats or steal my prawn toast but so Goddamn fucking happy he is here.


I wish I could show my gratitude to him to the full extent but we dont speak the same species.

614,I’m So Tired of Being Lonely,"“You need to love yourself before you can love someone else.” “You should learn to be happy being single.” I’m fucking tired of hearing that shit. How can I be happy when I have this void in my life, this need for a genuine and close human connection? How can anybody be happy when they’ve been taken advantage of or tossed aside in the process of searching for that connection and having nothing to show for it?

It’s exhausting, every moment I’m not at home I’m pretending to be ok. The smiles, the jokes, it’s all a front I put on to survive the day. I know being in a relationship will not solve my problems, it won’t fill the void in my life. No single thing can fix me, but the root of my depression right now is this feeling of desperate loneliness that eats away at me constantly. The fear of living the rest of my life without anybody hangs over my head.

I have friends and family who want to help me, but they can’t give me the companionship I’m missing. My therapist can only help me with my internal issues, therapy and medication can’t change the world around me. 

I’ve spent the last year of my life putting myself out there, pushing myself beyond my comfort zone, and I genuinely feel proud of myself for that. But I feel insane for trying over and over again, letting myself become vulnerable, and getting hurt. I can’t be angry at these people, I’m the one who keeps making this same mistake. But what’s the alternative?

I feel like my only options are to kill myself, to keep trying and constantly getting hurt over and over, or to just accept that I’m just going to be alone forever. I don’t want any of those things, but it’s becoming clearer to me that those are my only options. I just want someone who i can share life with, and I truly believed I could have that but wether there’s something wrong with me or with the people I meet I’m learning that it’s just not something I can have.",26,bp5bhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bp5bhe/im_so_tired_of_being_lonely/,2019-05-15

619,My parents called the cops on me today.,"I'm 30 years old. Just moved back in with my parents after being on my own for 5 years. My boss had been picking on me for 8 months, ever since i turned down a promotion that was not a career move in the direction i wanted to go. He has been blaming me for things that obviously arent my fault, made me stop taking time off (despite me taking no more than anyone else), told me to bring my laptop to my grandfathers deathbed so that my coworker could take a 2 week ski trip uninterrupted, made me and no one else in the company (salaried, office job) work christmas eve, new years eve, new years day, etc etc etc. The list goes on. He was bullying me and it was affecting my mental health. My dad was very aware of all of this bc he worked for the same small (50 ppl) company so could see these events unfolding. He advised i start looking for another job bc thihgs just kept gettig worse.  

I moved in with my parents because my lease ended in April and i knew i wanted to leave the company and didnt want to be tied down to one location in my job search. Unfortunately, the job search kept getting put off because of the extra hours i was working to try and get my boss off of my back, and the stress it was all causing me. 

I moved april 25th. Around the same time i was moving, my boss decided i could not use conference rooms to focus/get work done any more. This is a common practice at my company, and i had been doing it without problem since i started 4.5 years ago. I have ADHD/anxiety/depression and have been classified with accomodations throughout my schooling. I never mentioned the need for accomodations to work bc it was never a problem for me to sit in a conference room to get stuff done when i needed to in the past

When it became a problem (he accused me of trying to ""force myself into having my own of office"") i brought up my need for accomodation, and when he said i was lying, i brought a letter from my therapist. Our ""HR"" person's response was ""everyone has anxiety idk why you think you deserve special treatment"". Boss refused to accomodate me (remember the accomodations were something many others do on a day to day basis without issue), said i cannot ""mandate"" him to do anything and then tried to put me on a 60 day disciplinary plan for ""causing disturbances"". 

I quit. I couldnt take it anymore. This happened within a week of me moving. During that same week, my car was hit twice (and the damage is worth more than the car is worth. And long, irrelevant story, but i cant go through insurance to het it fixed), aaaaand my old landlord is actively trying to unjustifiably steal my deposit to make upgrades to his house he is trying to sell.

It has been a shitty year.

My parents are trying to be there and be helpful but they arent great. Im trying my best to be understanding of the fact that they dont fully understand and are trying to help. 

Today, i was trying to apply for a car loan and started having an anxiety attack. I'm sure you can imagine, it is not easy for someone who is unemployed to get approved for a loan. It turned into me getting angry and resentful at my employer for the whole situation. Which led to my dad saying ""...well...YOU quit...""

They have told me a number of times that they want to help, but dont know how (i have said things to them like ""i dont want to exist""). To which i reply with little things they can do such as letting me vent sometimes and validating how im feeling. This was the exact opposite.

I lost it and blew up and knocked some stuff off the side table (an open can of seltzer, some coasters, etc.). 

 This led to them CALLING THE COPS ON ME. They are claiming it was bc they want to help me and didnt know what to do, but there was clearly no imminent danger to me or anyone else. And even after the cops left they were going on about ""destruction of their property"". It had nothing to do with helping me. They did it because they were pissed there was some seltzer on the floor.

I already felt so lonely and now i feel more alone than ever. I cant even confide in them anymore because they use it against me. I just need a fucking break.

Thanks for reading if any of you out there made it this far.

624,I wrote this poem a long time ago and thought you guys might appreciate it,"Colors
What if I woke up today, 
And saw the world had turned to gray?
Would my life still be the same,
If everywhere it looked like rain?
People no longer black or white,
Days no longer day and night. 
Feelings dull, no passion here,
All that’s left to fear is fear. 

Life without hope or happiness,
Years go by, and still I miss,
The feeling of a gentle kiss,
I’m lonely in this gray abyss. 
My world is colorless, you see? 
And days go by just like a dream. 
Cold and abandoned, all alone,
My heart is cold and hard as stone. 

I’ll never let the color in,
It hurts too much to watch it dim, 
And fade away until it’s gray,
I’d rather it just stay away. 
Forget the highs, embrace the lows
Forget what it’s like to be let go. 
If you fall in love, and give it your all,
All you’ll receive is your biggest fall. 

Is it all a big mistake? 
To love and give, and give and take?
All I know is I can’t let go 
I hide behind this face I show. 
I feel the chills run through my veins,
As sadness is all that remains. 
The feelings that I have each day,
Are best described by the color gray.",51,bp9qej,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bp9qej/i_wrote_this_poem_a_long_time_ago_and_thought_you/,2019-05-16
625,"My brain feels empty, I have no drive or interests","Warning: 3am rambling thoughts ahead.

Im a 22 year old male, diagnosed with depression about 4ish years ago. Currently living with a couple friends and recently I’ve noticed more often than not that I seem to have nothing to say to them. Not only that but I feel as if I don’t have many thoughts in general. Like my mind is on pause or slow mode. Striking up or keeping a conversation going is becoming unnaturally hard. To the point that I end up coming off as awkward or stupid as I run out of things to say when nothing comes to mind; or as I stumble over my words. I imagine that sounds quite odd to someone who doesn’t have depression. That one can have no thoughts or simply have nothing on their mind. I don’t feel down, or upset in anyway that often, just empty I suppose. Removed. Like a background character in the lives of those around me and somehow, even my own. I don’t feel in charge of my life. I struggle to find motivation to do simple things like fold my laundry, or get out of bed. Textbook depression I suppose but knowing this often doesn’t make things any easier for me. I also feel as if I have no interests, or passions. Everything’s “alright” in a sense. Nothing stands out above the rest as something I want to do long term. Could I see myself being a plumber, yeah possibly. A sociologist, sure why not. Becoming a gym nut, yeah I enjoy working out. It seems those around me have passions they enjoy and take pride in and accept them whole. But when I think about things I want to do with my life, whether it but for a future career or just things I find enjoyable at the moment, I struggle.  Yeah I find all these things and more interesting and somewhat enjoyable, but none of it captivates me. I thinks that’s about the end of my ramble now lol.

627,Anyone else not want to talk about their depression because you’re afraid people will think you’re only doing it to make them feel sorry for you?,"Deep down I do want them to feel sorry for me. I want them to sit down with me and talk with me and tell me everything’s okay, but if they knew that’s what I want then it won’t happen. They’ll feel like I’m only looking for validation. That I’m being selfish in talking about all the pain I have stored away. Which is partially true, I suppose.

Whenever an appropriate opportunity comes up I want to mention my best friend’s suicide, but I always restrain myself because I’m afraid that people will think poorly for me because of it, thus only making things worse and making me hate myself even more.

630,my first therapy session is next week.,"i'm in my 30s and have been depressed for most of my life. my anxiety--amongst other things--made it extremely difficult to reach out. i didn't want to be a burden. i lost my voice to ask for help. so i sat in my own hell and stewed in my metaphorical garbage that has accumulated over the years. trash island would be proud.

i have a joke about it:
i've got so much emotional baggage. when i travel by plane i have to cram all my shit in boxes and ship them first. it's more economical. can't run from your problems folks.

recently my depression has been spiralling out of control. the worst it's been in a long while. over a month ago i quit my job because it was making me crazy. i needed my sanity back. i needed to rest. i need to work on myself.

no job? no need to get up. wallow. cycle. spiral.

i'm exhausted. time to make a decision. reach out and make a real effort to get better, or go out in a blaze of glory. 

i decided to put effort in climbing out of this abyssal plain. i'm tired, the journey will be long and difficult. but i've heard stories of fellow humans escaping it's gravity. i am a human, just like them, in theory i should be able to follow in their footsteps. more like baby steps; day by day.

so back on topic. my recent accomplishments include setting up that appointment--terrorfied--and i got a physician. i haven't been to the doctor in many many years. i have an irrational fear about it. i've put some effort in keeping this meat bag functional and hoped nothing would break. but maintenance needs to be done, it's long overdue. 

i also did real exercise for a week straight. i broke the streak today which I'm annoyed about. but exercise! i totally did some.

[ rant ]
today was difficult. had plans to meet up with friends and on the drive almost had a meltdown. centered myself as much as i could but the base is wobbly. park and rummage around for my mask. 

hey. it's good to see you. how are you. i'm alright--i lie. i don't mean to lie. friends shouldn't lie. i'm sorry.

time passes and for a brief moment i was alive. not overcumbered by demons and the darkness that follows. i held my torch steadfast and wielded them off. i breath, these moments are rare.

i leave; back to reality. my torch starts to dim. demons inch forward. fuck off demons. fuck off already. aren't you guys tired of this shit? fuck out of here. 
[ end rant ]

if you made it this far you are awesome. i appreciate that you took the time to read this ramble from a nobody. hope you find peace. and if anyone needs to talk i've been told that i'm a good listener.

I have still yet to get a GF, after all, whose wants to date a socially awkward little loser who is still on minimum wage at the age of 22. 

Before I know it, I'll be 25, then 30, I can't keep carrying on the way I am.

642,I fucking hate my life.,"I am constantly depressed all of the time and I am sick of living this way. I just need to vent about this. 

Everyday it is the same thing; get up, go to work, come home, get stoned, sleep, repeat. I never enjoy it; work is just going to work with the same people, listening to then blab on about whatever is going on 24/7 while I mind my own business and just try to focus on work. Nevermind anything I have to say because it most likely will never be acknowledged anyway. Anytime I have anything I want to add to the discussion or want to talk about (ex. Hey, look at this new song I made), they are just like, ""Oh really? Cool,"" and that's the end of it. Who cares about what I have to say because no one gives a shit anyways. 

I am never confident in myself and or the things I do. I always feel like everyone comments on every shortcoming of mine or makes it clear what weird things I do that I think should just be normal personality traits. Everybody wants to constantly help me because they think they know better, instead of just letting me figure it out for myself and try to do it. Let's not forget that people just expect me to go with the flow on everything; earlier my dad's friend told me that we were going to play darts. He didn't ask me if I wanted to, he just told me to come out because that's what we were doing, despite the fact that I woke up this morning depressed as fuck. 

I can't even talk to people around me about my issues. Everyone always comes to me and starts pouring their heart out over everything that they're dealing with, but when it comes to my issues there's no one who is capable of helping me (I am seeing a counselor). Everytime I try to tell my dad about my problems he always makes it about him or tells me to just ""get over it"". I even told him once a while ago about how I ""never feel happy, just feel content,"" and he straight up told me that he doesn't have anything to say about it, and just started yelling at me about how I was doing at work. Nevermind the fact that my mom died last year from cancer, now I am the one that has to be emotionally stable and in control since no one else in this house is capable of such. 

Not even my hobbies give me pleasure. I've invested a lot of time and money into electronic music because I am very passionate about it, but anymore I am never excited about making it because it is an endless struggle of making the perfect song, trying to go for these standards that I can never achieve, while endlessly comparing myself to other artists who I feel can do better. I can never have the same level of respect for my music that I can for other people's music, and even then this is reinforced by how I feel like no one gives a shit about it anyway. Whenever I try to show someone a song I made or what-not, just an ""It's alright, or it's not bad,"" and they've already moved onto something else. It's not until I tell them that I made it that their tune suddenly changes, which just feels disingenuous anyways. 

I constantly feel alone and trapped in my head, forced to deal with being this unhappy soul surrounded by people completely unaware of just how shitty I feel. I'm gay and came out to my dad not too long ago, who doesn't get it and/or understand it and makes a big deal out of it like some petty child whenever it is just mentioned. I was talking about how I have been using dating apps and was trying to prove how coming out as gay wasn't just a ""cop-out"" so I didn't have to date anyone, and my dad was standing there putting his fingers in his ears going ""blah blah blah"". He also thinks it is selfish for me to not have kids and makes it clear that he feels this way with no regard to my feelings whatsoever. 

Even trying to socialize with other people is a pain. I can't do small talk and it's hard for me to make social connections with other people. Even around my closest friends I feel like I have to play this role of being the ""funny guy"" just so I can get someone to pay attention to me, even if I feel like garbage. Half of the time I wonder, ""why the fuck am I even here?"" Everybody always wants to make it clear how ""important"" I am and what-not but it just feels fake. When I hang out with these people I feel invisible. People tell me that I try to go too deep with social interactions. 

Anyways, I feel worthless and invisible to the world. I don't feel like anyone close to me really knows me and I don't even feel happy about myself anymore. The only moments of clarity I get is when my depression subsides and I feel okay for the moment. I don't know why I am here and feel like being here is just a waste of time. I feel this urge to just take it out on myself in some way, maybe it would feel better to rip into myself in some way.",70,bph9l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bph9l8/i_fucking_hate_my_life/,2019-05-16

You are not too young, too old, too rich or too poor to be depressed. It’s not exclusive to men, it’s not exclusive to women.

Depression and suicide are not a contest. 
Depression and suicide are not a badge of honour.
You are not better than others because you fall under a group that is more at risk than the rest of the population.
You are not better than others because you’re “worse” than them.

657,Does anyone else ever find their suicidal ideation strangely comforting at times?,"I was talking with a friend about this yesterday and I was telling her that sometimes when I'm feeling really stressed out and overwhelmed, I tell myself not to worry about it too much, because if worst comes to worst I can always just kill myself. That sounds terrible, but it's true. Thinking of it as a Plan B if anything ever goes so terribly wrong that I can't come back from it actually keeps my anxious brain from focusing so much on the problem that I can't get anything done, and weirdly enough, that thought always relaxes and comforts me enough to actually push through the issue instead of just sitting around freaking out about it. 

Sure, I'm probably gonna flunk out of college within the next year while saddled with a lifetime of debt anyway, but hey, I shouldn't worry about it too much cause I can always just kill myself, right?

Sure, I feel directionless and hopeless right now and I'm probably still gonna feel that way all throughout my twenties, but hey, if I don't make anything of myself by the the time I'm 30, I can always just commit suicide, so it's like... whatever.

Perhaps I’m thinking about it wrong though. I liked art for awhile but I stopped practicing because I was depressed and now I don’t have the same feel for it which annoys me.

But the thing is, even if I give up, don't give up, whoever you are. I notice you and your struggling, even if no one else does. Chin up, buttercup. I see you, and even if no one else is proud of you, I am, because you're still alive. I'm rooting for you to live, whoever you are, because people who can see through the veil society puts over our lives are rare. You're an amazing person, whoever you are. If I could meet you in real life, I'd take you out for ice cream/whatever you can eat, because I don't know what your dietary restrictions are, and give you a hug. Depression and anxiety are not something to hate or be ashamed of. Be proud of yourself and who you are, and what mental disorders you have, because I'm proud of you.

Now two years later I went to try to get some outpatient health treatment for alcohol and drugs. At a private facility.

I figured since it had been 2 years I could be honest. Then they pushed the gun question and I made the mistake of being honest about that too. I could tell at a certain point if I didn’t do whatever they asked that I was going to get locked up again. Once she said something along the lines of duty to report I figured I was fucked. I was this close to getting locked up again.

They made me call my wife, while my marriage is already on the rocks, and ask her to remove the guns. I had to put it on speaker and everything. Then I had to spend the rest of the night trying to talk my wife down, awesome! But at least I was able to walk out so I guess I got off easy at this point.

You can’t ever be fully honest with these people or they will take away everything that matters to you. Your freedom, your job, your marriage, your kids. Somehow, they can’t understand that if I am already depressed locking me up is just going to make it worse? I was this fucking close to losing it all.

I see no point in any of the holidays (birthdays, christmas and everything else you could think of). For me, holidays are just a pointless excuse for people to gather (and suffer each others company).   
We just work until we die, we breed just so another souls could be trapped in this hopeless world and continue to do the same and live by the same unrealistic rules of society. Why?   
There is a huge lack of emphaty, endless wars, homelessness, greed and tons of suffering. Why are people even having children anymore?   
For me, every waking hour is literally hell, i can not even describe the feeling.. But it would be similar to being underwater and being crushed by this huge pressure. I think i feel physical pain via emotional pain, but at the same time i am so empty inside. All i feel is emptiness and depression in this world, never even the slightest moment of happiness.   
I literally feel like i am on the wrong planet, and that i belong to a planet free of any diseases, feelings of depression, feeling of greed and Ego. 

I literally wish i was never born, i have been depressed since i remember life, hence the feeling i am on a very wrong planet.

&amp;#x200B;

Everytime I think about my life and how my parents have fucked me over in my life.. I just think about ending it all. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was a kid in elementary school - my parents put me in special education classes even though they knew I was smart because  they wanted to draw a check from the government from me and kept me on the government assistance and in special education classes. I dropped out of HS because I found out in my Sophomore year that I would not get an academic diploma and would not be able to go to college, I dropped out and got my GED. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've never had a real friend in my life, because while I was growing up I was not allowed to have friends, they forbidded me from having friends outside of school and I was an outsider anyways. I was not allowed to go anywhere by myself at all in my life.. not to the movies, mall, anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Starting at the age of 15 - I worked two jobs. Helping my parents with a paper route at night and I had to do that every night and I couldnt even say that I didnt wanna do it. I was the one who put the papers in the car at night, folded papers, threw papers, stuck papers in a newspaper tubes, had to keep track of who stopped, who started, who went on vacation. If we ever got a complaint, it was my fault. I lived on fucking eggshells, because I was deathly afraid of my dad and didnt wanna get yelled at because we got a complaint from someone. and no I did not get paid to do this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also worked full time another job during the day and all my checks went to my parents until the age of 24, I got sleep whenever I could, which was not much. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I wanted to go hang out with my sister, I had to ask to go - most of the time I was told no and this is after I was 18. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was not allowed to have a boyfriend either - I got married when I was 27 - because it was my first relationship ever and it was the worst mistake of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got made fun of my whole life too about being overweight. They would call me names because everyone else in my family is skinnier than me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever my mom was mad at me, or she was mad at my dad .. she would threaten my life. I remember a couple times in my childhood/adulthood she chased me through the house with a knife and threatened to kill me. I had to lock my bedroom door to keep her out. 

&amp;#x200B;

My sister was allowed to have friends, she was allowed to go out and do things, she was allowed to do whatever she wanted to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I remember when cellphones first came out, it was late 2001/early 2002.. my parents and my sister went down to the suncom mobile store and they all got cellphones but I wasn't allowed to have one.  I did not get a cellphone until I was 21 and thats when I was able to save up enough money to buy a prepaid phone. But my sister had a phone all the time and it was even paid for by my parents. I had to buy my own phone and pay my own cell phone bill.. and some months I didnt even have service because I didnt have the money to pay the bill. 

&amp;#x200B;

We also had a computer before computers became popular - we had dial up internet too. I was only allowed the computer for 2 hours a day and it depended if I was good in school and didnt get any marks on take home paper from my teacher - if i had marks i got 10 minutes for every mark that was deducted from my two hours. Some days I was not even allowed on the computer, because I had too many marks even though most of the marks were not my fault. But my dad told me I was a liar and I got those marks, my teacher would mark off everyones paper if everyone in class was being disruptive or he felt like marking everyone off for the same behavior even though i would sit in my own cubicle and do my own work and be quiet. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was in elementary school and I remember this very vividly - My parents sent me away for a weekend.. I don't know why. But, they sent me to the Mountains of NC to live with a lady Easter Weekend who could not have kids. She was very nice to me though. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did not get presents for my birthday and even one year my parents ""forgot"" my birthday, I've never had a birthday party. At most .. I would get a homemade cake, if I made it myself. But my sister got whatever she wanted, she got to go out to eat for her birthday, birthday cake, money, basically whatever she wanted. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents didnt teach me how to drive, I still dont know how to drive at 28 years old. But they taught my sister how to drive. They bought her cars, paid for her insurance, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

My dad died five years ago - he committed suicide infront of me with a gun - it has fucked me up for the rest of my life. I cannot unsee what has happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

After my dad died - my mom drove me 2500 miles across the country to her home state of Arizona and a week after living there she kicked me out - i knew absolutely no one there and had absolutely no money - she called the cops on me and they told me if i tried to go back they would arrest me.  A few people with a heart, took me in. They paid for my bus ticket back to my sister in NC. I got back home, found a job and then my sister made me giver her all the money I made. I had no life there either - She controlled my life at 24 years old. Her and her husband was abusive towards me. I was always stuck at home because I was not allowed to go anywhere with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got back to NC Easter weekend of 2014 - in Jan of 2015 she was arrested on drug charges - the cops actually raided our house because her husband was on heroin.. which i didnt know. I was woken up out of a dead sleep by the cops busting down the door.. They almost put handcuffs on me .. but one of them said, not her she has not done anything wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

At that time, I went to live with a family friend for a month and I called my aunt in Texas and asked her if I could come live with her because my sister was arrested. She told me yes, In March of 2015.. I left NC for TX. Just my clothes and my dog &amp; I have been living here ever since. 

&amp;#x200B;

In October of 2017 my mom moved in with us - it was a horrible time in my life. She almost got me fired from my job. The day after I was promoted in my job she tried to take a bunch of pills to kill herself.. i had to take off work because of her. Then she was stealing my pain medication because I have fucked up genetics and live in pain. So, I had to quit seeing my Dr. In April of 2017.. She woke up in the middle of the night and started hitting me.. and defending myself against her.. I punched her and she had me arrested, and I had to sit in jail for 12 hours until I got a bond. Then I told her she had to leave because she couldnt be near me anymore.

694,Friend committed suicide,"So I just found out today that one of my friends killed himself a few days back. We weren't very close, but we had stuff in common (depression, sexuality, gaming) and he was a good friend. It still doesn't feel real.

He even texted me before he passed, mentioning how bad of a friend he was and that he was going through a real rough time with his ex and stuff. But he texted me at 2am on a weekday, AND I WAS ASLEEP. I replied to his texts before I dragged myself to work in the morning, but he never managed to read my replies...

The thing is, we're both bad texters and it's not uncommon for us to take about a day to respond. I didn't think anything of it, though I did follow up with a text asking if he felt any better. I thought he just needed some space, you know?

So today, after 3 days, I got a little worried and messaged one of his close friends on instagram, only to find out he's gone. I don't know what to do. What to feel. It's just all numb again. 

My depression hasn't been bad for over half a year now, but I can feel myself spiraling down again. I know how to get myself out of this funk. But I don't want to. I feel guilty for even thinking about trying to make myself feel better. 

I feel like I could have done more to help him. I know I could have done more. I just... really wish he was still here...",81,bq3tc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bq3tc1/friend_committed_suicide/,2019-05-18

696,The thought of having to work a 9-5 for the rest of my life kills me,"How are more people not depressed, I really don't see the point in any of it. Especially for minimum wage. Just to end up in a grave afterwards.

Like even if I saved up loads of money and could buy a brand new car it still wouldn't make me happy, only a relationship would which you can't buy.

It's a bit more understandable if you had a good group of close people around you or have a relationship as I'd do it for them but I have neither.

I want the pain to be over with, the past 6 years have been hell, I find darkness in the brightest of light. 

I don't see a future for me, I want to travel the world go to Germany, Italy etc but have no money to go and no girl.

700,I just want to feel like I matter to someone.,"All my life I've been that weird dude sitting by himself. I'm not even sure if I've ever had any real friends before. I mean, I had people I used to hang out with regularly, but it was generally on their time, and nobody would really go out of their way to hang out with me. I was always kind of the ""backup friend"" for when nobody else was around. I've had a few people I've considered my best friend, but I'm fairly confident I wasn't theirs.

Relationships are an even worse situation. I've only been in one ""relationship,"" if you can call it that. It was long-distance, we never met irl, and most of the time when we talked she would just tell me how badly I was treating her, gaslighting me, screaming at me, or if she was with her friends she would roast me with them. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind a good natured roasting, but they always took it way too far into things I was genuinely self-conscious about. I could go on and on about this relationship, but it doesn't matter now anymore. Nobody cares. Every time I bring it up to anyone, they change the subject or tell me to man up and get over the fact that some internet girl I thought I loved was mean to me.

I tried the whole online dating thing, all the apps, even the Reddit subs. I've even tried just looking for emotionless hookups just to lose my virginity (spoiler alert: still a mega virgin), but none of that works when you're a guy, especially an inexperienced and unattractive one like myself. I've met up with two girls so far that I met online. The first one was originally supposed to just be a hookup, but it didn't pan out that way, which honestly I didn't find surprising. We got together for coffee anyway, and texted back and forth here and there. We were supposed to hang out today actually, but she forgot and made other plans, which honestly I kinda had a feeling would happen for some reason. I'm not quite sure what I was expecting from this one after the hookup thing didn't work out. I think it's pretty clear that we just weren't clicking, but I guess I just like having some human interaction to look forward to, even if it's just hanging out with someone that has zero interest in me for a short while. She was also incredibly attractive, which I guess is probably a factor in that too. I did learn something from our coffee ""date"" though, that I'm incredibly boring to talk to. I'm a good listener, but I just can't talk about myself at all unless I'm talking about some kind of hobby I have in common with someone. My life is so empty that I have nothing to talk about that isn't going to make me sound like a total downer, besides my hobbies, which most people have zero interest in hearing about.

The second girl I met from a dating app. This one was looking for ""more than a hookup, less than a relationship."" And described it more as casual dating. Okay, never tried that, but it's not like I have much else going on so why not. So we go out, another coffee date, and I think we hit it off really well. There was a lot to talk about because we had a lot of common interests, so that was kinda refreshing. She's been a bit slow to respond to texts after our date, but she seemed really enthusiastic at the end of it, as well as in her texts. She said she's interested in another date, so I'm hoping that goes well. I'm not really holding my breath though, I have a long history of feeling confident and excited about things and then having them go horribly wrong, so I'm not gonna let myself get too excited.

Anyway, I'm not quite sure where I'm going with this anymore. I guess I just wanted to vent or something? I don't know. I just want to have someone that I really matter to, someone that cares about me half as much as I care about them. I'm tired of coming home to an empty apartment every day, feeling the same emptiness day in and day out. I'm 22 years old, and it feels like I'm just gonna end up like one of those 30 year old virgins who has given up on life, and I'm terrified of that increasingly realistic prospect.",38,bq6dl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bq6dl4/i_just_want_to_feel_like_i_matter_to_someone/,2019-05-18

706,This cat saved my life.,"I originally posted this under ""assistance"", but it seems that nobody was interested in reading it. I have removed any links to donate and re-posted it here in hopes of just receiving a few kind words or an ounce of support. I'm extremely depressed and have been experiencing PTSD from recent events that are a separate circumstance in itself. I guess it was stupid of me to turn to the internet for help, but many tears have fallen writing this short personal story I just wanted  someone to read it. I don't know how I will live without Memi.

At the age of 13, I took all fifty dollars of my carefully earned savings and walked one mile towards the local plaza hair salon. I intended on getting my unruly hair professionally addressed in hopes of boosting my near rock bottom self esteem.  Instead, I stopped into the neighboring pet shop and laid eyes for the first time on the love of my life.

She was a calico kitten with a unique coating that set her apart from the other kittens. She was a bit awkward looking, and a bit outcast from the rest of the litter. I felt an instant bond to this tiny majestic creature that would go on to be my divine spirit animal and greatest companion. As fate would have it, the cost to purchase this lovely kitten was exactly $50. With a bit of cleverness to forge the required permission from my parents, I was free to walk home with my newly adopted daughter in a small paper box. We named her Memi.

We weathered storms together over the next decade. She grew as I grew. She was present and resilient throughout all of the turmoil and tribulations of my teenage years. When I was removed from my childhood home and placed into a group home for many months at a time, she was there waiting for me when I returned; prowling in the rafters of my parents' dilapidated house. Nothing consoled me or felt more like home than the purring presence of my feline companion.

In April 2006, an electrical fire broke out in the old cabin we resided in. Sheer panic consumed me when I returned to the cabin to discover smoke and and flames quickly spreading from a back room. I searched frantically for my baby until firefighters and police arrived and pulled me away. In that moment, nothing else mattered but the safety and survival of my sweet, innocent cat.

The smoke and flames soon overcame her. A brave police officer eventually found her lifeless body behind the front door of the still burning house. She was not breathing, and she had no heartbeat. Time stopped when the officer somberly approached me and handed me her singed, blackened, and limp body. Paramedics placed a newborn oxygen mask on her face, but could not detect any signs of life. ""I'm sorry"", they said as my whole world shattered into pieces.

Then a miracle happened as I held her in my arms. Memi moved her head just the slightest bit, and suddenly she took a momentous breath of air. Her eyes opened slowly, and within minutes she even had the strength to take a few small steps. A kind neighbor rushed her to the nearest animal hospital where she was treated for smoke inhalation and burn injuries. I was treated for smoke inhalation and released, eagerly awaiting to reunite with my miracle child and nurse her back to health.

Memi went on to make a full recovery. Her burnt fur and whiskers grew back, and she regained her vibrant athleticism. Her feisty personality, regal stature, and intelligent demeanor were a wonder to behold. Memi shines constant rays of hope and survival. It gave my family the strength we needed to cope with the loss of our house and everything we owned.

I can say that I'm a hard working, compassionate, ambitious, and courageous person. I’ve survived abuse, depression, grief, illness, and adversity. No matter what the loss or hardship, Memi has been there for me. Her wise and mystical energies have encouraged me to continue living in some of my darkest times. There are a few instances in my life that I truly feel I may have succumbed to suicide if her gentle bunting and healing purrs weren't there to help guide me away from a path of no return.

In April 2019, I kissed Memi on her forehead before departing alone to Sri Lanka for an extended trip that would change me forever. On the morning of Easter Sunday, the neighborhood I was staying in was afflicted by horrific terrorist attacks. The proceeding weeks were filled with both enlightening experiences and memories that will haunt me for the rest of my life. All the while, I thought of Memi's loyal and protective spirit awaiting my return. I knew in my heart that she needed me, and I needed to make it home safely to reunite with Memi.

Last week I wearily returned home from Sri Lanka and discovered with great sadness that Memi had grown very ill in my absence. She had been under the care of a loving family member who reported a timeline of her worsening symptoms. On May 13th, she was admitted into an animal hospital for emergency treatment and diagnosis.

Memi has had several tests done and a procedure to remove fluid from her chest cavity. The current prognosis is that she is experiencing severe heart disease and co-morbid pancreatitis and cancer. The goal of her hospitalization was to get her stabilized, diagnosed, treated accordingly, and brought back to the comfort of her own home. Now that she has been discharged, she will remain on medications and closely monitored for the rest of her precious life.

I paid the bulk of my savings, roughly $5,100 for her initial diagnostics and subsequent hospitalization. The expenses for her palliative care are estimated to be upwards of $7,420. This is significantly more than I have saved or can expect to earn in the near future.  At this time, it's difficult to estimate any additional costs of medication and treatment. It has come to the point that I no longer have enough funds to pay my rent next month or provide Memi the best quality of care.

I've been blessed with a fulfilling career as an independent contractor, but very recently I lost my two main sources of income due to sudden corporate budget cuts. I'm working diligently to contract new sources of income, but I feel I've been greatly destabilized by unexpected income loss and recent traumatic experiences while traveling abroad.

Please help Memi get through this painful ordeal. The kindness of strangers can move mountains. Donations to Memi's veterinary fund will directly help to improve the quality of life of an incredibly special and beautiful cat. I also welcome any informational resources about obtaining financial assistance for vet bills and medication expenses. I will gladly provide bill statements, photos, updates, and any other records or information that can support this plea for assistance. 

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. My love and support go out to any other pet parents who have been in similar situations. I can promise that any kindness and support I receive will one day be paid forward to the best of my ability.  Much love and heartfelt blessings to all.

But ever since than, it's just a burden and I have to pretend to my friends and family that I care. I know it's probably just part of growing up, but it doesn't make me feel good that my birthday is the only day I get people to act happy around me, and that I get attention from them. It also sucks when other people's birthdays are celebrated like national holidays in the hallways or classrooms, and makes me feel like a fucking dumpster.",60,bqbwdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bqbwdg/nobody_cares_about_my_birthday/,2019-05-19
710,Opened up about suicidal thoughts but got abused.,"Before I begin, I haven't slept for about 20hrs now so pardon ant mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

I've finally fallen to the lowest possible bottom. I made up my mind to talk to my family and relatives about how I feel and that I've been feeling suicidal lately but it just went worse from there. They hurled insults saying I'm a shame to the family and bought shame upon them as Ive had thoughts such as that. And I've been watched everyday as if someone wants to steal everything. I've lost freedom now as I'm always underwatch.

I now feel worse than before. Feels paralyzed and as if like you can't do anything about it. Generally people suggest to share with family and so called ""loved ones""; guess what, it back fired. I would've ended it before this even began. Now I feel 10 times guilt and hopelessness. I've got no friends really. Not a single one. Had one till 2015 he left for Canada. Been weeks since I even smiled. Broken sleep and worse appetite everyday. I get insulted once a while by my family saying I've bought shame upon them by opening about it.

Well... I honey don't know what to do next. I used to work with 3d CGI graphics before. I'm loosing interest in that too.

Before you write your thoughts, I want to let you know this, I've tried very hard since 2013 to make my family and parents proud. Tried everything. Started to learn painting, photography all by myself and even the 3d graphics design as in for games. None of them worked. Although the results were likes by many people, I even tried to get a job based on that but got rejected as I was self taught and didn't have a degree on that. That broke me apart as I spent 1000hrs or more for 2 years in learning it. In other words. I've tried everything. I think it's best if I don't exist. This time is not the time for me to shine. I'm surrounded by hopelessness. Next stop? Honestly, I don't know. I wish I died in sleep or overdose.

716,Just realized I'm not over my ex-wife,"Married 11, total together over 15 years. Separation + divorce is 2 years. I'm turning 44 this year, she's 38. We were together almost half her life.

Have two beautiful children, 9 and 11. 
Their spending the night with me - a rare occasion ♥️ 

She's out partying, enjoying being a single mom.
I'm 5 months unemployed, again, third time since we've separated. I live with my brother. Down to $19 in the bank. Had to cash in my stocks. I got an email that Office of Attorney General is taking my IRA and giving it to her - child support. On the plus, it means my child support is nearly caught up. On the negative, I have absolutely no money. No car. 

Attitude of Gratitude. My brother is a wonderful provider. Doesn't ask anything of me. However the sense of Me being a Burden, hits me incredibly hard every single day. More than 50 job applications, only 3 interviews and a dozen, ""Unfortunately ... we regret to inform you ... we've chosen another candidate for the position"" emails. 

I start school in a few weeks.
I haven't set foot in a class room in over 20 years.
I'm getting cold feet. I'm thinking it's the worse idea ever. Getting myself into $30,000 debt.

I miss her. I hate her. I love her. I miss her.

719,Today I realized I cannot kill myself.,"I was on the computer, late at night like always, when my brother came down crying to me. Back story: About 8 months ago there was a kid at my brothers high school who killed himself. Really popular, volleyball player, super nice, everyone liked him. Obviously when he killed himself the whole school was in mourning. 



Back to today: he came down crying and was telling me how much he missed him. My brother and him never talked much (I believe that they had a class together), but he was absolutely distraught - the only time I'd seen him like that was when our grandmother died. I hugged him, told him he was a good kid, and sent him off to sleep. When I got downstairs, I couldn't hold myself, and basically just collapsed on the floor. I've had countless thoughts of suicide over the past four years, but the only thing thats held me back at times was the idea of traumatizing my family, but even that idea has been starting to slip from my mind recently. My brothers reaction, crying over someone he barely knew who died well over 8 months ago, made me realize how much of a burden I would place on so many people for years and years, and I cannot bring myself to do that.",98,bqf4tl,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bqf4tl/today_i_realized_i_cannot_kill_myself/,2019-05-19
720,I don't understand why suicide is bad.,"I think you should try and keep living how long you can, but if you can't do it anymore there is always the easier way out. You don't have to be afraid, because if life keeps hitting you so hard for so long that you can't even feel a little better for a minute, you are already in hell, so you don't need to be afraid of life after death. I mean what worse can happens, when you already feel like being ripped inside out and it just won't stop. You don't need to be afraid of anything, not gods (if some exists, which I think they don't), not people, not anything. The people are the worst, they'll just make you feel bad about yourself and some people when they see that you are even just a little weaker, they'll use you and keep using you for pleasuring themselves, because they don't care about you, and that's why you shouldn't care about other people, you should only care about you and your family, but only if you have real family relationships. Actually, I was thinking about suicide for a long time too, but right now my life it isn't that bad, but I'll probably do it someday. Anyway, people should be thankful that something like suicide exists in this lonely world.",101,bqfy3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bqfy3z/i_dont_understand_why_suicide_is_bad/,2019-05-19

727,"How long can this go on, and wtf happened?","“you have so much potential,” is something I have heard all my life. And while I know that my brain has a higher capacity of many other brains, it’s still damaged.  So ridiculously damaged.

Years of trying to make people happy never led to anything. I would spend hours looking for just the right gift for someone. Noticing their likes and dislikes, wondering what face they would make when I would give it to them… At times I got the “OMG this is perfect!” reaction, other times I could see the appreciation, and happiness. Other times things were normal. 

I was never much of a materialistic person. I like to be plain. Why? Idk. Many people tell me I am so pretty, if only I did my makeup. If only I straightened my hair, if only this, if only that. 

But nobody knows how awful my life is. Waking up every day hating what you have become, hating that person that can’t live in this world. Knowing that anything you do will be unsatisfactory to many, appalling to others, that you will be criticized…. What about the times that I was normal? That I genuinely lived life, and my mental demons weren’t there?

I know people don’t get it. But when merely walking down the street gives you panic, when going to the grocery store and potentially seeing someone gives you a full blown panic attack… it really ruins you day. Having to count to 100 before opening the door to leave the house…. It hurts.

“Oh cheer, up, everything is fine…” that’s another one. No, everything will not be alright. There is a chemical imbalance that doesn’t not allow me to be anything else but the neurotic, self hating, self-nauseating person I am. I know people don’t think about us as much as we think they do, but we can’t help but think that they actually do. 

Suicide was on my list for a while… but I can’t even bring myself to do that, because I feel I would leave problems behind fro everyone else. It’s not because I actually love myself that I don’t do it. 

I used to love myself. I used to be narcissist and full of myself, a social butterfly. Now, even though I am lucky to have what I have… I feel miserable. I feel alone, I feel putrid, I feel like a smart dumb ass. Idk why I wrote this… but it is just how I feel now…",28,bqi69d,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bqi69d/how_long_can_this_go_on_and_wtf_happened/,2019-05-19

735,Escapes aren't working anymore.,"I'm a college student that's been barely passing or failing classes for the past 2 years. This quarter is over in a month and I'm failing everything again. I lied to my parents about this, saying I was doing well, but couldn't handle the guilt after I actually checked my grades (D's and Fs as expected) and told them the truth. They yelled at me for a while then told me they're going to stop paying my tuition, meaning I'll be dropping out as I really have no interest in the degree or classes.

Until I came out to my parents about my grades, I was doing ok emotionally. I've had recurring on and off depression for the past 7 years or so but was doing ok until last week when the guilt was physically hurting me and I had to tell them about the grades. 

The escapes I was using were pretty standard:  smoking lots of weed and video gaming and junk food. However after the guilt set in a few days back I've been incapable of any of that. Every time I smoke weed I start crying and thinking of suicide. No appetite unless I smoke weed, so my stomach's hurting from hunger and despair. And I get physically and emotionally uncomfortable every time I sit down to play videogames so I've just put away my laptop because  I get sick just looking at it.

Why am I forced lie to my doctors to stockpile medicine for months that will statistically be unable to kill me whe overdosed and cause unnecessary pain and permanent damage?

766,My experience with depression/anxiety,"After years of struggling, I sought out help last year. Saw a therapist, and then a psychiatrist (3 different ones actually). 

I went on a cocktail of meds, antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds, antipsychotics. It lasted a few months. 


I did everything by the book. Not only did I do the whole doctor thing, but I socialised, went out with friends frequently, was physically active, and has a nice relationship, ate healthy. 


 I had a support system. Basically everything you should be doing do deal. 


Eventually, everything started crumbling down. I got the point of self harm. It was a very brief period thankfully. 


Everything I did to help me cope with these constant feeling of dread stopped helping me at all. 

After all that, I stopped therapy, quit my meds and I felt okay for a week or so after the meds left my system. 

But, the last few months, anhedonia is the word I'd use to describe my emotive state. Nothing at all brings me pleasure. I even used sex as a coping mechanism, alcohol, benzos to feel even more numb so I don't feel my anxiety. 


At this point, I don't know what to do anymore. I've been avoiding a very important responsibility for months, and I think I fucked it up. So my future is a mess right now. 


I don't think I need to be on suicide watch or something, I just don't know what to do to feel okay or contempt or pretty much anything. 


I don't know if I'm asking for advice, or am I just ranting. But this is my side of the mental health BS I deal with every day.

About 6 months ago, I was probably in the worst place I’d ever been in; I was failing college, my friend had tried to overdose and I’d been stuck chasing a girl who didn’t want me. But things changed, my friend got help and is doing much better, my grades have come up and that girl and I are now pretty good friends. I’ve got an amazing girlfriend and honestly life is pretty good. I look back to where I was and to where I am now and to be honest if there’s one word to describe my journey it’s fucking pride. Pride. Pride in how far I’ve come, pride in my decision to take control and pride in every little thing I’ve done that’s made me as happy as I am today. It’s crazy how quick things can change in 6 months and trust me it won’t hit you until it hits you. Anyone out there struggling, we’re all different and I understand that I can never understand but hopefully you’ll be able to find some sort of peace like I have done. One day you’ll wake up and realise that your life now is pretty good and reflect back on when you were at your lowest. You’ll realise in that moment, that one fucking blissful moment, that there is hope. Please don’t let the demons inside you take control. Show them whose boss.

There's no Mother anymore, either. So no Mother-of-the-Bride specials, no grandmother to my children, no squeals of happiness when announcing a pregnancy. 

It's then, I realize, that you have to be in a loving relationship to be married and start the wanted family. You have to be someone worth loving like that in order to get those moments. To get the special proposal, the memorable wedding that you want, the house you worked for together, the children that you wanted together. 

It's unbelievable to me that I will ever be engaged, married, or with kids, for one reason or another. I don't see it. I don't see how I could deserve it. Not everyone on this Earth is going to succeed in life the way we want to. Some of us will be failures and I have to accept that. And as accepting as I'm trying to be, it's hard to not be sad.

But over the years ive become more and more withdrawn, and alienated myself, and now i cant even hold a single friendship. I cant keep friends, because im too needy and expect them to care as deeply for me as I do for them, and it hurts when they don’t, because none of them are fucking clingy and constantly afraid of being alone. EVERYTHING hurts my fucking feelings to the point i wish i could rip them out my body and become some brain dead robot that cant feel anything, and actually i tried my best to do that, and it doesn’t hurt any less now it just makes even less sense than before. My “goals and aspirations” change on an hourly basis. I just need friends that i can actually be close to and feel a genuine connection. I hate the total indifference people have towards how others feel, and the way that when everyone asks how I’m doing, I have to tell lies and make shit up because truly no I am NOT “alright” i’m spending a good portion of my life in despair, feels like a constant freefall in the deepest layer of hell.   
  I know im a worthless POS but i dont know wtf to do i have limited options in my life and opportunities that move a little further away the second i try to reach them.

I am crying in the toilets at work like the pathetic useless little bitch I am. Nobody fully knows what is going on with me, some know a lot and are supportive but feel like they losing their patience in me as i am not getting any better in my head. Most people have no idea and that means most people in the office strongly dislike me because they will have invented their own “theories” on why i have died inside and treat me like some fucking dickhead whose taking advantage. Every fiber of my body is telling me to fucking end it, constantly evaluating every day whether it is still worth going with this. I get no joy out of life anymore. I try to give others joy but thats about all i am useful for, and im not very good at it, especially considering im always angry and upset and people take this personally (which is totally understandable, I’d hate being around myself as well).

""*I'm not telling you your feelings are invalid - but it's wrong that you feel that way considering there's nothing wrong with your life. You have a roof, you have food, you have two loving parents, you have two arms and eyes*.""

""If you don't go to your appointments, I will put you in the hospital. You're just getting worse - you don't even want to go out anymore.

""I don't love you, you're just our responsibility. If you kill yourself or die from your diabetes, I'll get arrested and then your siblings won't survive without me. Stop thinking about yourself for once.""

When going out, I try to look down at the ground and not wear my glasses, so everything is blurry and I can't see people. It makes me feel like there's nothing around me, so I don't feel as scared.

""Stop looking at the ground, you look weird.""

""Stop being anxious! Act normal, have your back straight, and walk like a lady.""

He starts shouting at me, and it feels horrible when he does. And he wonders why I don't want to go out at all. 

I don't go out with my mom, because she makes me feel I do everything wrong. For something I'd be doing, e.x.: I stir my coffee for a while so it's dissolved into the water, and she gets ANNOYED because of it and makes some remark. I'm not next to her when I do it, so she can't even listen to the stirring or the noises it makes; it'll happen when she goes to the kitchen, and sees me doing it.   
Or she'll come to my room and get a clothing item (she has too many clothes, so she uses my cupboard as well), she'll make a comment about my weight or her weight, or something related to food. Whenever I offer my advice or my opinion, she suddenly gets defensive and starts attacking me for it, like: Ohh, you think you know everything? tone. I never even imply that 'I know it all and you don't'.

798,Read this if you have enough time to waste.,"Hey. I am in high school (10th grade) in France, so I am sixteen and I don't know if people my age feel this way too.
I've always been an uncommon person, not really sociable, until this year.
I hope it won't be too boring or complicated to read but I just need to vent.
I always feel ""empty"", you maybe know, not the sad empty, but the emptiness of someone who doesn't care about anything. Sadly I didn't choose that and it fucks me up but, keep in mind that I always live with my brain, not my heart, so I'm never really there, in real life. It's actually very hard for me to turn my thoughts into words, I often stutter and give up on speaking.
But it's strange that, I don't really care if I have friends or not, people don't really summon my interest. Actually I don't really taste anything in life but I don't feel sad and it bugs me. Because I don't feel sad, I don't feel bad nor good or great, everything just feels tasteless you know? And it's been this way for more than one year now.
Yesterday I had a meeting with five of my teachers and I broke down in front of them.
I felt like I could cry, and cry and cry and cry for hours, I couldn't even speak anymore. And that was a meeting about my future. But I don't feel like finding a job, nor doing anything.
I have this great thirst and curiosity for knowledge, but having a job just disgusts me for some reason. Well it doesn't. Just the idea of having a job doesn't interest me. Everything is so lifeless and tasteless in real life.
Maybe you've heard about the big exam changes in France, and obviously I'm a part of it. And it saddens me so bad, I feel like my future has been stolen from me. I feel like I have missed something. I don't know if I should talk to a therapist. When I think about an idea, I make up sentences in my mind, and when I type them/say them out loud I just can't ""remember"" them, it becomes so foggy, so unaccessible.
Also gained a lot of weight over the months and can't control my hungriness. I actually don't feel when I am full or hungry.
Also need to quit social-media because it steals my life, but I just can not. I feel miserable and powerless but it doesn't really get to me at the same time you know.
I don't know what is wrong with me and if something is wrong with me. Everything just seems equal to me .I am just lost right now. Sorry for wasting your time.

Guys I've been soo bummed out recently after my dad forced me leave a job at a place I really loved working at. Good people, good company everything, decent pay. I'm from Pakistan and the reason he stated for me stop this job was i was in  very bad company as per him. I'm married and have a 1 year old and I cant provide for them anymore. We're not financially struggling. My dad's been taking care of our expenses. But i didn't want that I didn't want to be fed my whole life they are my responsibility and i have to be the one to provide for them.

Secondly he forced me into technical studies and I'm not very well suited for them ""Physically"". It has become a dead end for me, i can't even see a future for myself let alome my wife n kid. It has gotten to the point that I've told my wife leave me n go to her parents but she refuses to leave my side at a time like this (Which i appreciate immensely).

In all this torment now my dad told me find a job my previous company isn't hiring me and at this I'm not eligible for shit and can't find a decent job anywhere. The stress has taken such a mental toll that i got migraine a few months back and it's not going away anymore.

I have nothing to do in my house, I've been such a wuss (my family's words) about this matter according to them.

Guys I feel lost and I'm ashamed that i can't comfort my wife n kid in a time like cuz I'm whining about my own shit soo much. I'm getting worse n worse even in the things I've been perfect at. I'm losing myself, i need help.

833,It does not get better.,"I'll be thirty in a few months. I've been struggling since J was a teenager, but during my twenties I tried as hard as was humanly possible for me to stay positive, live in the moment and trust things would improve.

This didn't happen. Sometimes, you are born into/place in situations early in life that will simply ruin you. You have a 1/1,000,000 chance of pulling yourself out of it, and althought people will tell you that they care, they do not have the capacity to due to their own lives and they own baggage. 

I know I will not get better, there are no more avenues for me to chase to try and do so. Even if, by some miracle, I did manage to get my own head functioning normally, I will have always spent the first thirty years of my life terrified of everyone and in almost total isolation. 

I am too tired to care anymore. I just don't want to have to continue slogging away and listening to the same old bullshit from better off people. I want to be strong enough to endure this for my mom and my sister's sake, but simply put, I am not.

She said she would allow me to go see a psychiatrist in order to get on medicine for it, but hasn’t said anything lately, I think she’s in denial. The reason she was angry with me this morning is because I told her I would go workout with her this morning, and I set a bunch of alarms but I am just so physically exhausted all the time it’s hard for me to wake up. I will lay down in bed so early but can never fall asleep till around 2 or 3 a.m. just because of all my thoughts. She was running late because of me, so I apologized and told her to just go with out me. She yelled at me, claiming how disappointed she was in me. I am currently home from college for the summer, without a job or any friends to spend time with. I applied to at least 10 places but haven’t heard back from any.  I’ve bought some self help books and I go to church on Sundays to try and make some type of effort. I don’t know if any of you have experienced depression and/or anxiety, but if you have you know it takes such a toll on you. I never want to do anything because of it. I told her I would go workout with her because I know I should want to, but I just don’t.

I accepted that I'll never see worth in life anymore, that somehow nothing will ever matter to me, and nothing will ever be too important enough for me to rethink staying in this cesspool.

My mind has constant tirades to myself and I'm exhausted, both mentally and physically. I will never find my peace and I my mind will never shut up until I do something, and this is my plan, my last goal and I hope to succeed even if it's dark.

I don't want to be a burden anymore, to myself or to anyone else. To my family or to my friends. I searched for meaning and came empty-handed.

840,A really usefull app for depressed people ( found this on the Ask Reddit sub),"Virtual Hope Box. Mental health app. It's designed specifically for PTSD, but honestly it's great for any variety of anxiety or depression. It's also completely free without ads. Long ass description incoming. 

TL;DR if you have mental illness, download this app, it's super awesome. 

It has four main sections. Distract Me has simple puzzle games to refocus your mind. No pressure from time limits or score keeping, and most games give you an easy way to get hints if you get frustrated. 

Inspire Me has a database of inspirational quotes; it shows one at random and you can swipe for a new one. You can mark favorites to give them priority in the randomization, you can remove quotes that rub you the wrong way, and you can add quotes if you know one that isn't in the app. You can also choose to have daily notifications with a random quote, at the time of your choice. 

Relax Me is guided exercises. The deep breathing one is my personal favorite. This one is customizable in every way. You can set all the lengths so that the exercise is tailored to your breathing capacity, and edit the background images/music. You can also choose whether to have prompts, visual and/or audio. Also in Relax Me, there's muscle relaxation and several guided meditations.

The fourth category is Coping Tools. You can make coping cards specific to your needs. Like for example, you can create a low self esteem card that has a list of things you do well and positive traits you have. So when you're feeling worthless, go look at your card, and you'll see exactly why you aren't. It can be hard to make cards by yourself, but a therapist or supportive loved one can help. The other part of Coping Tools is a calendar for social engagements, like lunch dates.

There's a fifth kind-of category called Remind Me. It lets you upload photos and sound files. You can use these to customize the other parts of the app, or you can just look through your library.",213,brri6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/brri6r/a_really_usefull_app_for_depressed_people_found/,2019-05-22

Whilst waiting for my urine and blood test results, a doctor entered the room and began to lecture me.

Some of the things he said included:

“No one is *born* with depression. Depression is not biochemical.”

To which I said- ‘yes, but couldn’t you be born genetically predisposed?’ and he responded condescendingly ‘I’m the scientist here okay.’

“You’re not going to like what I have to say, but: There is NOTHING wrong with you.”

“It’s all about choosing the healthy coping mechanisms. Like. Smoking versus swimming.”

I was literally in tears by the end of his lecture and have never felt more invalidated. As if I enjoy feeling miserable.

It made me more suicidal if anything.

I got to this point because I’m always looking to accommodate others. I’m always anxious about bothering other people and them being disappointed in me. 

I recently realized that there’s nothing I actually enjoy doing for my own sake. I cook because I enjoy seeing others enjoying my food. I work because I enjoy seeing others being satisfied with my work. When I think of living all by myself in middle of nowhere, there’s nothing I would enjoy doing. 

I don’t have any purpose of living. I’ve had enough of all experience that I want to have. I’ve experience romance, despair, success, and failures. I’ve laughed and cried. There’s nothing I’m looking forward to in my life. 

I thought about dying. No one would notice for a while. 

But I can’t. I know my friends would be sad. I know m coworkers would be sad. I know my parents would be devastated. I can’t die because I don’t want to disappoint them. I can’t ever do things I want to do.

853,"Modern society is causing depression, tip of the iceberg late night gibberish","Depression is not a chemical imbalance
Depression is not genetic 
Depression is not a biological disease 

Depression is a small mix of a few of these misconceptions, although to call depression any of these terms would be an ignorant misunderstanding of the depth and complexity of depression and it’s lack of understanding despite our modern advancements. 

Depression is debatably all of these things while at the same time it is none of these things at all. The complication is a lot more than we are able to understand or comprehend correctly and that’s precisely why there is no one way to describe the plague presented upon modern society. The complexities of depressive mindsets are at core, the primal human nature unsuccessfully assimilating into human expectation and lifestyle of modern day life. 

Society is breeding a depressive mindset and the more we continue to advance in this nature the higher the rates of depression will rise. Depression is a cause of social and cultural fragmentation and isolation from ones self. We are forming a society incapable of adapting to the basic human needs while trading comfort and happiness for materialistic values, social norms, and constant competition inside our society pushing stress to the limit for the mere purpose of fulfilling the social expectations and societal needs. 

We are all blind to the apocalypse unrolling rapidly right in front of us and before we know it depressive nihilism and pessimistic anxiety are going to be considered normal and even expected in our society. 

We are overworking ourselves on a daily basis for exterior motivation. We are unsuccessfully adapting to the constant stress and forced motivation only to accomplish unfulfilling goals. Nobody is realizing how pointless day to day concerns and stressors really are and instead they let useless issues overwhelm their mind and life. The depression in our society is a sense of endless worry and disappointment in the hopelessness presented in our age’s mundane template that people are supposed to fit into whether or not it fits them. 

Depression is the 21st century. It consumes and effects the life of every person in America but despite this we have no solution or even diagnosis on depression that is actually accurate. Despite depression being such an insanely prominent issue that is growing quicker than imaginable it still hasn’t been scientifically understood in the slightest. We don’t know what we’re dealing with, but we are throwing false diagnoses and handfuls of pills at the issues which we can’t even comprehend, yet nobody sees this as troublesome. 

Putting it simply, we are focused on the modern expectation of how you should live your life instead of worrying about anything that matters. Our concerns and preoccupations in life are changing as well as the assumptions on how you are supposed to carry out your daily life if you want to succeed or not be an utter failure. The bar of expectation for what is supposed to make you happy is altered to the point beyond return. If we don’t open our eyes soon real human happiness will be a rare occasion and we will instead continue to evolve into the mundane robotic lives fueled by nothing but anxiety and fear of failure. In a way, we are brainwashing the population away from self appreciation and stripping away self sufficiency as a whole. Soon human nature may as well be disregarded completely while the mentally exhausting perceptions of life in society steer us further away from natural reality. 

We are creating an artificial world incompatible with the non artificial realities of human psychological needs and purpose in life. The obliviousness upon us all is absurd and one day we will regret not taking mental illness seriously enough when our consumerist society has transformed us into mere robotic machinery of the future. Slowly but surely independent thought and general freedom are being harshly stripped away in an attempt to control the masses not physically, but also mentally in the 21st century uprising of depression and suicide rates. 

With technology being on the edge of innovation the future is a terrifying idea that most definitely will not end well. The more that we continue to advance in this manner of modern ideology the closer we get to complete population control and inevitable human self destruction.",24,brz8nj,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/brz8nj/modern_society_is_causing_depression_tip_of_the/,2019-05-23

My mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia when I was only a 1 yo baby. My father started drinking heavily because of this.

I was not properly raised by my father which led me to be socially awkward throughout my whole life up until now. School, friends, church, work, every fucking where I experienced either indifference, rejection and even bullying. I have never had a girlfriend before. I have social anxiety, which 2 therapists referred to as ""not so serious"", though I constantly freak out about everything: from me dying from a horrible dessease like cancer to worries about my family.

I've tried self-help books, tried to get better with my weight, tried to do small steps, which I thought would lead me to a more happy life. Nothing has worked so far. It actually is getting worse and worse. A week does not pass without me crying and sobing and it's just horrible. I just want a normal life and even when I try to acomplish it, everything goes downhill. People still treat me like shit, avoid me, dont want to contact me. When I try to engage in convos, I either get ignored, overtalked or even laughed at.

How am I supposed to fucking change myself for the better if even changing myself is showing no fucking results?

I've said things to myself like: ""Well, this is expected, but keep going. Dont mind what other people think about you. You are making progress just at a slower pace."" And for a few hours or days I may be good, but then all of the shit comes back to punch me in the face.

My uncle was in the Navy. My friend was actually a paramedic. People assume that because she died of an overdose that she was a bad person. She was not. She was just like most of us. She was depressed and Xanax soothed her pain, despite lots of us telling her to drop the habit.

They pointed somethings out to me, made suggestions, and straight up heard me out. It made a world of a difference than the wreck I was when all this news broke. 

It is okay to not be okay. If the world is shit for you today, go talk to someone. Anyone. A stranger. Someone in the park. A barber. Whoever. There is someone out there willing to listen. 

I keep telling me that things happen for a reason, even though some of these things feel they happen for no reason. 

I am human. I feel. I hurt. I laugh, cry, and get angry. It is normal. It is beautiful that I get these feelings, even the dark ones. I embrace it, because to live another day and to beat the darkness will mean that I lived on to see the light. 

I am depressed. And I will beat this.",59,bs1lpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bs1lpw/my_uncle_and_a_best_friend_just_died_within_a/,2019-05-23
860,"When I tried to overdose, the EMT asked me if I was just doing it for attention.","I tried to OD when I was 17, but it didn't work. 

When the ambulance showed up, I was so out of it, the one thing I remember was laying in the back of the ambulance, the young male EMT asking me if I just did it for attention, because I did such a bad job.

I wish I had remembered this sooner, because I wish I could report him to the hospital or something. 

I think it was more traumatic than the experience itself, how the first responders treated me. The police handcuffed me when they took me from the hospital to the involuntary committal inpatient center.

Sometimes this is motivation to never try killing myself again, because my life was never worse than in those few days afterwards.

872,How can I (31f) beat this depression after fiancé left 30 days before wedding,"Hi Guys. I apologize if this is a long post. I am a sufferer of severe anxiety (where your hands/fingers tingle, shallow breathing, stomach ache, freaking out in public) and have had my share of depression on and off. 

 My ex fiance and I had been together for 6 years, lived together 3.5.  Our wedding date was set for May 11, 2019, and we booked our venue April 2018 (were planning for 13 months).  We were never on and off and never broke up.  This was a man that literally told me I was beautiful every morning, kissed me every night before bed, we were truly best friends.  Our couple 'arguments' consisted of dumbass shit, like housework, or just stubborn who's right about a fact of some sort.  We had no infidelity, financial issues, jealousy problems etc...  Except, one day we went shopping together for me to pick out my bridal shower dress. We held hands in the store, drove top down like we like, loving the weather.  When we got home, he seemed a tiny bit tired (we went to 4 stores and yeah, he's a guy) so I picked up his clothes he bought off the floor and he took the shoes in the shoe box i bought and threw them off the bed hard into the hallway. I asked why he did it and he told me to leave him alone.. This caught me so off guard because there were NO RED FLAGS, NONE AT ALL.. I would have NEVER known something was wrong, as he never treated me this way.  I became a a little unrelenting asking why because I obviously foresaw an issue and he wasn't telling me.  We went to bed.

The next morning, he got in the shower at the EXACT time he knows i get up to get in the shower and took all the hot water (he never showers in the morning EVER, only at night) so I calmly asked him ""is the water still hot?""  he told me to ""fuck off"" and that he ""didn't know why he was with such a LOSER like me"".  I cried all morning in the shower scared to death of what was happening. 

Then. 30 days before our wedding, my fiance called me at work and told me he ALREADY spoke with his mom and cancelled my bridal shower (which was the next afternoon!) and that he told her to contact all the guests and call the wedding off.  I am not in denial, this was COMPLETELY, OUT OF THE BLUE (well, to me at least, he never acted ANY DIFFERENT WAY TOWARDS ME).  He proceeded to then never come home that day from work, and I found he's been staying at his mother's house for the past 2 months.  When I called her, she didn't answer (which her and I got along), and when I've tried to contact him, he doesn't reply AT ALL. We all live in the same neighborhood so I've seen him driving around with his friends, playing disc golf, walking OUR dog, and acting just fine.  

I'm not in a point where i want to get an EPO on me or anything, or chase him around, so I've accepted that something happened and I'll never have answers. I'm in therapy now, but I'm turned SUPER depressed.  I feel manipulated, betrayed, used, and downright worthless.  Questions rack my brain 24/7 and i can't get rest.  

 I feel helpless and the depression is getting to where i cry in the grocery store on the ground because I can't help it.  He eventually got a lawyer to tell me to not contact him and that he wants to sell the house.  I just want advice on what YOU would do if this was your situation? I know most people would say 'there's no way this was out of the blue', but it was.  This man was freaking amazing and he treated me as such too.  I know there must have been an issue, but i don't know and it's eating me alive.  I am so sad and my future is just ripped from me.  And the indifference he has shown is like demonic tbh because this is NOT the man i know to be so cold hearted.

I disagree a lot with what people have to say, just so I can piss them off and maybe make them feel worse than me. I have no love to give anymore.

My mom struggles with paranoid schizophrenia. She's stopped taking her meds several months ago and I can't stand being around her, everyone in school makes fun of her. I feel like shit. I get mocked for everything. I get into fights all the time now and I've never been in a fight before this year. 

I've had to see a judge for truancy. He let me off cause he felt sorry for me. I'm sure other people feel sorry for me too but just dismiss me as another degenerate that'll end up on the streets. I've started drinking after my dad died. I drink a lot and cry myself to sleep at night. I sleep outside in the woods cause it's quiet and I can finally find a little peace away from society. I hate everyone, if I don't, I find something about them to hate, I make something up and let them know it. There is nothing that's going to make me better. I'm spiraling out of control.

I tried for a while to get a job as I'm currently not doing anything with my life, but quickly got discouraged after putting a few applications out and not getting any calls.

My mom basically considers me a disappointment and a burden. I lost my health insurance since I was on the government shit and they don't like it if you don't work or go to school. She tells me that if I were to get sick she could lose everything. She could pay for me to be on her work insurance but doesn't and frankly I can't blame her, I'm not worth it. Luckily I don't have to deal with my parents too much, as my mom works in a different state and my dad is divorced from her, so I basically have the house to myself. It's not a bad situation in that regard.

I'm not passionate about anything, and frankly the only reason I'm going back to college is to maybe have some hope at getting a good job where I can support myself. The only things that bring me comfort anymore are smoking weed, playing video games, and TV shows/anime. It goes without saying that I've never had a girlfriend (20 year old virgin, haha).

So last night i decided to take an IQ test, from just the 1st 4 questions i couldn’t even go on, it felt like so much effort, my brain just felt like its  on fire so i just stopped. 

I didnt do well in high school at all so i didnt go to college cause my grades were too low, right now im working as a nanny and honestly i hate it but i need money.  Sometimes when i read its hard for me to understand especially when the vocabulary is intense, its come to a point that i have accepted that im not gifted academically and that ill never be a someone in life. I cant even meet the guy of my dreams cause i know how man love intelligent women. And the worst part is that want to have a smart boyfriend and every time i set my standards low i just get annoyed so it seems like ill never have the family i want and ill never succeed in life.

Im just so sad cause i think about it everyday, i want to be able to know math, be able to read novels, be able to work in the cooperate world but im scared that will never happen for me. 

Anyway i just wanted to vent out maybe someone out there might have the same problem.",26,bsfgpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bsfgpm/24f_with_intellectual_disability/,2019-05-24
897,my dad told me he wouldn't care if I'd kill myself.,"The thought of suicide has been on my mind since early 2013, but I never spoke to anyone about. I've joked about a few times but no one around me took it to seriously, I was kind of a humorous person so It didnt bother anyone. six years passed and I'm 18 with no job and no friends and my family (mostly my dad) don't care about my well-being. yesterday I had an argument with my dad and told I wasn't motivated to do anything with my life. I'd lay in bed sleeping and watching yt videos cause that was the only thing that made me feel happy.

Later in the argument I told him I wanted to end it all, and he told me that he wouldn't care if I did. The fact that he said that in front of my family, I began to realise that I am a waste of oxygen and that it was final decision for me to do it so. Its kinda selfish for me to do it, but more selfish to have a kid and not care about the and their well-being.",117,bsfhxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bsfhxf/my_dad_told_me_he_wouldnt_care_if_id_kill_myself/,2019-05-24

900,I wanted to share my story...,"  

Hey guys,

So a few days ago I suddenly started feeling the urge to share my story with this subreddit. I have been reading posts on here every once in a while and I always felt that this is a great place. I feel that many people come here to share their experience and to hear about others'. More importantly, I think, this is a place where people who feel like they are helpless, hopeless, and friendless, realize that, in fact, there is help, hope and friends. I want to start this by thanking everyone on here, both those who come here looking for a way out and those who come to show others that way. I'm going to risk sounding like a clichéd bumper sticker, but I really think you make the world a better place. And yes, I'm including those of you who are suffering just as much as those who are helping.

Now, I know there have been many stories here about those successfully coming out of awful states of anguish, and many have shared some amazing insights they found along the way. But I don't think this is this kind of story. I don't see myself as having achieved a sense of enlightenment. Heck, I don't think I've even achieved mediocrity. I’m telling this story about my suffering, my journey with mental health, primarily because I have been with it for so long that I don't think I have ever fully encapsulated it. I also feel, like many others before me, that urge to share my story, just for the sake of telling someone else about it. 

It's not much of a story anyways. Like I said, I don't see myself as having achieved any great insights along the way, at least not ones that proved particularly lasting. I think that in the eyes of the general, everyday, ""sane"" public, my story is probably likely to seem completely meaningless, if not boring. To be perfectly honest, I was debating for the last few days whether I should even post this. I cannot see the value of my story. But then again, I am also listening to a brain that has practiced for an awfully long time the art of being deceitfully deprecating and diminishing. And so, in the end, I've decided that, for better or worse, I will share this story with others who might find it, at the very least, an interesting read. 

Nevertheless, I do truly hope that someone can find some benefit by reading this. I am hoping that someone might see themselves in parts of my story, and will be able to relate. Perhaps I can make one person feel less lonely, less of a black sheep. If I am being particularly optimistic, I even hope someone could find a general sense of hope in my story. Or they find that my way of seeing things can actually help them overcome some aspect of their suffering. Honestly, I'll be happy if you just found a sentence in this story that you could take with you. Something that could accompany you in your future encounters with the dark side of your mind. I would love to be able to give something back, and to make my story of pain a little less insignificant and hollow. At this point in my life, that is really all I truly wish for. I simply wish to find *some* purpose for my suffering, which so far has always seemed to be completely valueless and empty.

\------

I've been asked before when do I think I've started feeling this way. Did it start in my childhood? Did it start after I immigrated to the West? Has there been any particularly traumatic or otherwise influential events in my life that gave rise to my affliction? I could never point that out. How can you? When you already live a life that can only be viewed through grey-and-white shades, does it matter that there's color around you? I can only ever view my memories of the past in the same way I view the happenings of the present. I cannot see a happy tale, full of color and vitality. I can see a replay of events through grey-and-white shades. Even my image of the future, what I envision in my head, I can only see through grey-and-white shades. So how do I answer the question of when did it start? 

""Well, when did you first seek treatment?"" 

I went to my first meeting with a psychiatrist when I finally became convinced that, quite simply, something's wrong with me. I found I no longer enjoy things. I found every task to be particularly difficult. I found the future frightening and the past full of regret. I never found peace in the present moment. I always wanted to escape. I knew that there was so much wrong with my life, so I decided to make a list of things to talk to my doctor about in our first session. Today, I do not remember one thing on that list. There was nothing on that list that could pinpoint the problem. Nothing would even describe the problem. At the time, the best I could master was ""I feel sad"" and ""I feel afraid"". Whatever was happening to me, I could not even express it sufficiently. 

The worst part, after about a decade of this, I still can't. I have no idea what is wrong with me, what it is that I feel, or why that feeling is particularly bad. But I do find some silly comfort in the fact that no other professional has been able to succinctly and effectively encapsulate it. 4 hospital stays, at least half a dozen different professionals, and all I got to show for it is a bunch of medical terms, all of which fit me perfectly, and at the same time, are nothing like me. I have very little faith in psychiatry and psychology. At the same time, I have also known, almost at the very beginning, that a psychologist is what I want to be. I also still see a psychiatrist and a psychologist, and I often think that it helps. I contradict myself here, I'm aware of it. But I've also learned to be quite comfortable with being in the grey. Since all I've ever truly studied is psychology, I've learned to be quite OK with not getting any definitive answers to questions. I think I even began to embrace paradoxes. Certainly, I trust them more than concrete answers. 

So what was I ""given""? My first psychiatrist, who I have been seeing for around 8 years, does not like to give diagnoses. I did not like it at the beginning, because I really wanted to know what's wrong with me and what is the cure. But today, I truly learned to appreciate that kind of approach. The diagnoses I have later received over the years did nothing but confuse me further, making me identify with whatever sickness it was at the time. I would find solace in the label, and I would use it to explicate every part of my life. I would build a new identity on the foundations of that label, find more and more examples of new and previous experiences to further strengthen the construct. This would go on and on, giving me hope in the treatment that was specifically designed to ""cure"" the new ""me"", until eventually I would watch it crumble as would any other monument constructed using fluids as your foundations. **Fluid** is a word I eventually came to love and understand, as it can be used much more precisely to describe our identity and the illnesses that afflict us, particularly the mental ones.

I was given the label of mild depression, or dysthymia, at least until my first suicide attempt. I was also given generalized anxiety, and social anxiety. I've mentioned the moods and the constant state of fear characterizing my life. I should also mention how, during my first year in university, I've discovered that I am terrified of people, to the point that I could not take the subway during off-hours, without getting a panic attack. Sitting in a lecture hall with a few hundred or thousand others was pure torture. I was feeling as though every single person is watching me. I knew that that's not the case, but I felt it to be true. So I tried to hide. I tried to never sit in front of anyone else. I tried to always have my six covered by walls. God forbid if I heard people laughing. My hypothalamus would immediately consider it a social threat directed at nothing other than me. Then my ""rational"" brain would find a way to explain that feeling by imagining that there is something particularly wrong with me that everyone else can see. Perhaps a big sh\*t stain on my pants. Or worse, just being me is laughable. 

Although that was a terrible period of time, in and of itself, and has probably further exacerbated the rest of my condition(s), it is also the only part of my story with a happy ending. I can proudly say that I have managed to conquer my social anxiety to the point that I can function socially, sometimes even publicly. That's not to say that it has gone away. It certainly is still there every time I try to get out of the house, every time I am about to get on a bus, every time I have to sit in a class of any size, go to a restaurant, to the mall, basically anywhere that's not my own house. I know it's there, but in some weird way, it doesn't bother me anymore. The feeling of anxiety goes away, and I always know it will. The weird thoughts that accompany it sound hilarious to me. I find it easy to sit surrounded by people, without talking to them. I also find it easy (or at least, much easier) to initiate conversation. And I did that, quite simply, by talking to others, especially those of the other gender, even though I am experiencing a severe panic attack due to that. It was hard, probably the hardest thing I've ever done. But forcing this sort of ""cure"" is considerably easier than coming out of all my other afflictions. I started enjoying it. I needed to do it every day. And now, as I am married, I stopped. At times, I find it creeping back on me. When it happens, however, I always know that I can simply get over it by forcing myself out of it, and just that thought is enough to curb the anxiety.

Now, as for the generalized anxiety, it's never so simple. I wish, quite simply, that there was something that I *know* causes that anxiety. Unfortunately, it's almost always just there. Perhaps it is a combination of all my other thoughts. Perhaps it's my physical body somehow causing it. I've honestly no clue. I just know when it happens, and I know when it ends. I do not know how to prevent it, only some times do I manage to stop it (most often only temporarily), and even more often, I can't determine why it stopped. Of course, I wasn't always thinking this way. It was unbearable, but I always, always, felt that *one day I will find a way to make it stop*.

In terms of my depression, which was termed 'mild' at first, I cannot determine whether it was truly an affliction, or just a state of being. This was how I knew that something was wrong. It was all I could think about, and it was also the only way I could think about things. At the physical level, I became more and more tired, spending more time in bed every day. Things became harder to do, and I became ""lazier""- as I was told a little too often- often feeling physically weak. Non-physically (for lack of a better term), I became more and more aware of this sense of meaninglessness in life, a sort of ""blanket"" of futility that would cover my entire being. It was like the famous cloud-that-follows-you-wherever-you-go-scenario. I saw those pictures, and it was a great metaphor, even too exact to be considered a metaphor. It was even better when I kept seeing that the cloud eventually dissipates, and the sun does shine. Only it never did for me, not really, not for more than a few weeks, and only too rarely. 

At the beginning I was also very, very much controlled by my mood, and I was oblivious to it. This was, essentially, how I ended up in the hospital for the first couple of times. They called it ""impulsivity"". I guess you could say that. But it doesn't capture the essence of it. It wasn't as though there was this ""impulse"" and I just acted on it. It was more like there was an urge, so strong, that I could not do *anything else* but act on it. In as much as anything could force you to do something, this was it for me. I could see only that option, and no other option that does not also entail that option. It was the next step, the physical, next step. It was the next breath. I was in its grip, and not only could I not get away, I couldn't even comprehend the idea of getting away. Hence, drugs, terrible and volatile relationships, anger, black-and-white view of the world, and many, many mistakes. Hence, also, popping a bunch of pills, getting to the emergency, lying about it, getting out of emergency, only to go slash my veins as I realized the pills won't kill me. This was even more depressing, by the way, since I realized that I can't even kill myself properly. I failed to slash my veins as well, due to lack of proper knowledge and access to the right instrument. I was left with a whole bunch of ugly scars and nothing to show for it. Spent the next several weeks at the hospital.

This was where I got my next diagnosis: Borderline personality disorder. I love this one. It fits me so well, yet it's so wrong. First of all, by being given a diagnosis of a personality disorder, I later understood that the doctor meant I was too f\*cked up to ever be treated. It was also given to me by a psychiatrist who, after seeing them for the first time, made me lose my sh\*t completely. I don't think I've ever experienced that kind of temper tantrum before, or since. I don't remember much from that meeting, but I do remember that cold, uninterested, arrogant look on that doctor's face. It seemed to me that, in her mind, I was just another messed up kid whose file garners more attention than the human it describes. Mind you, this was the psychiatrist in charge of the child and adolescent section of the hospital. I wasn't searching for much empathy, either, I tend to feel uncomfortable with that. Whatever it was about her, it drove me insane in less than a quarter of an hour, made me vow I will never talk to her again, made her assign a different psychiatrist to me, and made me look quite different to all other staff. It also gave me that lovely diagnosis of BPD. 

And I loved it. I found true solace in that label. BPD. I read all the books, researched everything. I felt like it described me better than any other sequence of sentences ever put down by men. I especially identified with the chronic sense of emptiness characterized by patients of BPD. I do think that ""empty"" is a very efficient way to describe how I feel. Even to this day, I still believe in that word. But with its efficiency, also came a flattening of the complexity that is being a human being. It made my experience describable, but that doesn't mean that anyone else could ever understand it. When I told my primary psychiatrist that I feel empty, she showed me that she understood. I could see on her that she probably also understood that she feels empty, too. But she didn't feel it the way I felt it. She felt it in her own way. Other people feel empty, I'm sure, quite often. So when I say ""empty"" to describe my experience, they understand it because it describes their experience, even though they never understand my experience. ""Empty"" was a trap. BPD, likewise, was a trap. I do not care if, reading this, or having met me in real life, you consider me even the most BPD person in existence. What mattered to me, in the end, is getting better. BPD, the label of it, did not help me. It helped me get out of the hospital. It helped me find new things that were wrong with me. But it did not make me any bit better following the path that this label put in front of me. 

I lived several years after this hospital visit, with this same label, in a sort of limbo-existence. I wasn't really going anywhere, I was just trying to escape my past, my present and my future. I developed severe hypersomnia. It still afflicts me. I currently need 12 hours of sleep, on average, to feel like I am not completely exhausted, and when I wake up, I continue to feel tired as though I missed an entire night's sleep. Moreover, I lost that driving force that was accompanying me my whole life, at least in the form of anxiety, to succeed in school. I would drop out, and go back, I would take a bunch of courses, drop them, take others, drop them, and I have been cycling through that for the past 5 years or so. I should've finished my bachelor's degree in 2015, had I been consistent. But, I came to see, that is not my fate. From a straight A's student I went to the one guy who never shows up to class, spends his nights smoking weed and doing lines, disappointing his parents and failing socially with his peers. Not that I was such a social success before, anyways. 

These 'failures' still haunt me to this day. Even after so long. Even though I have analyzed the eff out of these thoughts, discrediting them to smithereens. Even after practicing mindfulness for years. Even after accepting them as they are, thoughts, they still show up. Every day. As soon as I wake up, before I go to bed, and quite often, even during my sleep. 

During the years after my first (and second) hospitalizations, I have tried so many different antidepressants and anxiolytics that I could open a successful pharmacy through my assh\*le. I found none that would help me for longer than 3-4 months. I tried mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, anything. None made a difference. I was still surrounded by this cloud. I was still seeing life through the grey-and-white shades. I was still terribly fearful and panicky. I still felt the overwhelming blanket of futility. Nothing has changed. 

Actually, something did change. With every new medication I started, I built up hope: ""this… this one is going to be the one"". And every time, I saw that hope crashing down to a new low. You'd think eventually you would plateau, in terms of the level of hopelessness you can experience. Turns out, it just sorta turns into indifference over time. I found that these pills did stop me from feeling suicidal, or at least acting on it. Some deeper inquisition showed that, while that may be the case, my deepening sense of indifference made suicide seem pointless. I started seeing how it will affect others, making me feel guilty in advance about it. So not only do I have to deal with guilt about failing my loved ones while I'm alive, I would also have to feel guilty when I'm dead. And besides, what's the point? Why would I bother planning and executing such an elaborate, and likely painful undertaking, if I could just lie down here, smoking weed, or drinking, or just doing nothing really, besides numbing my pain. Funny enough, I did succeed in killing myself eventually. It wasn't by taking my life, but rather by taking the life out of me. 

The more grave, and painful, the anguish became, so did I go deeper into this abyss, or whatever other clichéd term you have for it. With every new ""cure"" I've discovered, I've also found another things that my affliction is resistant to. These ups and downs of hope-turned-melancholy-turned-despondency-turned-optimism-turned-hope changed my the definition of my identity into a new label: bipolar. Specifically, bipolar II. I found no help in that label either, but at least I felt that this was closest to explaining my state. With all existing treatments for this diagnosis likewise not working, I started taking whatever medication just to keep me from going any worse. 

Several things also occurred in my *actual* life during this time that would seem to others to have made an important impact. First, my parents divorced when I was around 19 years of age. Although others would later point that out as something potentially ""traumatic"", I never considered it so. Even the fact that my father has left us, moving to another country, made barely any difference for me, emotionally, spiritually, physically, or mentally. It's not so much that I didn't care about them, or love my parents, it's more the fact that I was already so confused, so desensitized, so weak, and so tired, that there was nothing more it could do to me. To be fair, this happened even before my first hospitalization, but even at that point I was already so consumed by my own state that this made no difference to me. Mental illness made me into one of the most selfish creatures I could be. Never have I considered this to be an event of any gravity in my life, besides the fact that we were now poorer, and that my mother is alone. She was, however, better off alone than with my father, which is also why I never found it to be a big deal. If anything, it was a blessing. Looking back, even for my mother, the divorce wasn't traumatic. If anything made her life miserable it wasn't my father (or lack thereof), but me and my mental illness. It was spreading like a genetically modified strain of bacteria, designed to be resistant to treatment and destroy everything you love.

I have moved in and out of my mother's house in the following years. Following that same pattern of newly found hope turning to dejection I would end up moving back, every time, completely at a loss, weakened by life's blows, and appreciably more pathetic. I think these visits of the world outside my home did affect me, but not independently of everything else that was going on inside my mind. It was more like the environment was working in perfect tandem with my condition, strengthening each other with every step, while eliminating all other potential ways out. It was a beautiful perfect circle. A vicious circle, as it is called, which has taught me to despise not only my own mind but also the outside world. Now, I wasn't just afraid of the world, I also hated it. There was nothing here for me, nothing there for me, nothing in this life or in its termination. It was a dark time, and I have lost much of my memory of many things that happened during that period. Or perhaps, nothing really happened much during that period, so my memory just started to degenerate.

There were also some profoundly wondrous, beautiful, and overwhelmingly special moments. But then, I guess, considering what my life was at the time, it wouldn't be much to make me feel this way. It's not necessarily a bad thing, either. Being so downtrodden made me truly appreciate whatever gift I've received, whatever beauty or kindness life presented me with. It's worth noting, therefore, that when something truly good happened, I could experience a sense of euphoric appreciation that isn't captured by words such as ""remission"" or ""relief"". Nothing, of course, lasted very long, nor should it. It also didn't accompany me in my thoughts much. But such things did happen.

For one, I have gotten myself a dog. That dog has since been one of the greatest blessings of my life. Not only did I feel like I had someone with me, who loved me regardless of how I feel, who shared all these moments with me in profound silence, without judgement, and even shown me gratitude. Not only that, but my dog showed me that I was still able to love someone else, that I didn't despise everything, and that I can indeed be of importance to another being. My dog made me go outside, see the sun, breathe the air. My dog helped me create memories of times that were fun, even in my lowest of states. My dog made me feel that being tired and able to only lie in bed, all day long, is ok. That while there is so much suffering in our world, there is still something very beautiful that can be found in nature. I loved my dog from first sight. I was able to feel some emotions towards another being, even if it was only for that other being. I was able to cry and laugh and get angry and proud. I felt the profundity of embracing another being that you cherish beyond words. And most importantly, I felt gratitude, perhaps for the first time in my life. My dog saved me, not just my mood, but physically, too. In the subsequent few years I would find myself sitting contemplating suicide, but unable to do so, as it would cause too great of a pain to my dog. And that, to me, was worse than anything else I may be experiencing.

Another event of sorts, was my introduction with meditation and Buddhist philosophy/psychology. This was probably the only benefit of having been given the BPD label, since it made me research into potential treatments, through which I found Buddhism. I immediately became intrigued by it, and it preoccupied my thoughts ever since. I haven't found it helpful in the first few years, not in the long term. Sometimes, an insight or two would make me elated for a week. Eventually it subsided, however, and I was back to the same state of anguish. Meditation was really difficult for me to follow. Especially for several consecutive days, as I found it hard to persist in any task, really. But for some reason, whenever I left it, whenever I gave up, I always ended up finding my way back into it. Something in these insights made sense to me. It explained the world (my inner and experiential world, that is) in the most precise and unambiguous manner. And at the same time, it was inspiring and liberating, which made me see some meaning under the blanket of futility. 

I have spent all these years, on and off, meditating and contemplating. It may not have solved my problems, and it probably didn't alleviate my pain, but it made me view my condition differently. It made me able to step back, in a way, from my problems, and not be so entrenched in all this suffering. It made me less self-centered, which, coincidentally, is very helpful if your mind makes you suffer. It taught me the importance of letting things go. It taught me that my thoughts are not my fault, and neither are my emotions. That I could experience them without getting caught up in them. Even if only a little, and only sometimes. It taught me that I could enjoy being, that is, I could actually feel joy, which was beyond happiness or sadness. And I started being grateful, little by little, here and there. I started feeling calmer. But I would still suffer, and that same cycle would still continue. Yet, now, there was a place I turned to every time things got really, really bad. 

The next time I experienced a severe mental breakdown was several years afterwards. After I have solved my social anxiety and found the love of my life, I was experiencing a time of pure bliss. For the first time in my life, things were going the right way. I was in control, or at least, I was riding the waves in the right direction. That period was short and sweet, with an especial emphasis on short. After falling in love and spending several wonderful weeks with my girlfriend, I started going downhill- scratch that, free falling, into oblivion. Anxiety came first, then hypersomnia, then lack of motivation and lack of energy, and then a wave of depression hit me so hard it was like I've never been hit with it before. It was to be expected, as it happens, when you feel like you are ""higher"", which I very much did, there is much more room for you to fall. When I thought that I may be out of this mental torture, finally, I was shown that there was, again, no way out. This was the worst experience of losing my hope, which turned into desperation, and dejection, and just pitiful, pitiful wretchedness. 

The thing was, there was no bottom for me to hit this time, I just kept on falling. Indifference didn't protect me anymore, I kept on being battered and shattered over and over. My girlfriend decided to stick by me, as she became my wife by this time. I was now no longer alone in my suffering, which would've been great, except for the fact that it kept pulling me into reality to confront what I am becoming. I was to not only experience this fall, this suffering, but I was to also watch it as it is happening. I was going deeper into oblivion because, this time, I was carrying another person with me. And I was terrible. I was, for some time, so insanely depressed that I became psychotic. I was put on a cocktail of mood stabilizer, antipsychotics, antidepressant and anxiolytics, which was so heavy that I was the real walking dead. And I was lost. 

After a few months of this, I tried to commit suicide again, having already lost all sense of the previously-mentioned protective factors or attitude of indifference. I was hospitalized, this time in the adult unit. Funny enough, I tried to get hospitalized in the preceding months but was turned down for not having been suicidal enough. Even after this suicide attempt, the doctors wanted to release me. I had to actually argue for my case, convince the medical chiefs that they have an obligation to keep me, so I could receive proper treatment for the first time in my life. I was, for better or worse, experiencing a sort of fire in my belly, fueled by my hatred towards my condition, as well as by how long it has been lasting. I stopped being suicidal quite quickly, as always happened to me, and I had to convince the psychiatrists that my condition was, in fact, severe enough that I would be back here, over and again, had they not done something. 

So I managed to stay, and, with my new doctor, started experimenting with a new regime of medications. After a month, my time ran out, I discovered that there were medications that, once taken, I experienced worse agony than before, and whatever I was able to bear I was given an Rx for. Within two weeks of being back to the outside world, these meds were doing nothing, and my psychiatrist took me off. By this point, I sensed, my psychiatrist was just as pissed off as I was. So we began trying things that you aren't prescribed much anymore. Surprisingly, a certain type of tricyclics from the 80s and an anxiolytic from even earlier, turned out to be quite effective. They didn't eliminate neither anxiety nor depression, but it became more bearable. 

I think, the results of these meds are in part due to the fact that I have lost hope in the treatment. I stopped getting excited about my chances of getting out of my condition with new medications, and instead, opted to hoping for a flat line. My worldview changed. I stopped seeking treatment. I started seeking the ability to, in a way, suffer at a more consistent level, at least. I began accepting much of my suffering as part of the rest of my life. My task, right now, was to find a way to live with this. 

I guess, part of this was influenced by my new view of life, whereby happiness is not an important goal. I found that meaning, existential meaning, a sort of purpose to my life, was profoundly more coveted. It didn't matter, anymore, whether I was to be happy or to suffer. I had to do something with my life now. What is it I am going to do, that will be meaningful, I am not certain. I could not find much meaning in life before that, and I still struggle. I did find meaning in my suffering, however. 

Influenced by buddhist philosophy, I began to claim my suffering as a special ""gift"", not like a present but more in the sense of a ""skill"". Viewing my life, as it turned out so far, I believe that I have more to offer the world than had I not been through all of it, and continue to. With a child on the way, I have been struggling with questions of ""what do I have to offer the world"" and ""how do I make this life worth living"". I contemplate less about my misery, and more about what I could do for my family, and then, the society, if I can. 

One thing I did realize so far, is that with this skill of suffering I have learned, I have also become much more sensitive to others' suffering. I'm not certain how, but my sense of empathy has significantly increased, to the point that I can truly feel the suffering of others as my own. I find that I often become depressed, these days, not because of how I feel about myself and my life and circumstances, but rather, because of the way others, even complete strangers, feel. 

This, probably, is what compelled me to share my story. 

Like I said, this isn't a story with a happy ending. I hope, however, that this story has a meaningful ending. I am still struggling, just as much. I still see the world, often, from the eyes of depression. I still struggle to do a lot of what I want to do. It's hard for me to stick to a simple routine. I still struggle with my sleep, and I am doing all I can to try and find a solution. I still find myself plagued by anxiety for no reason at all, with no way to stop it. All these meds have also made me lose my health and gain quite a lot of weight. I struggle with the shadow of all these years I seemingly ""wasted my time"", and the fact that, by many standards, I still am. I have to deal with the fact that this was me, I have made all these mistakes, and I have to continue. The continuing part is probably the hardest. I have no other choices now, I cannot choose to hibernate or photosynthesize. I have to continue, every day. To experience the suffering of those I love is much worse that it is to experience my own. At the very least, I have to be determined to stay alive.

Finally, I just want to say that this has been a very long post, and if anyone has actually read the whole thing, I want to say thank you. Thank you for reading my story.",21,bsh7xr,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bsh7xr/i_wanted_to_share_my_story/,2019-05-24
901,Does anyone else suffer terribly from the physical symptoms of depression?,"The physical symptoms that I personally suffer from are usually aches and pains in and around my body, fatigue from the emotional distress, a loss of appetite, IBS, weight loss, mind fog, headaches (though rarely), panic attacks, sleep paralysis and insomnia. 

Experiencing both emotional and physical depression is the fucking worst as there doesn't seem to be a let-up period - not even a minuscule one. There's no form of consolation either. Usually, I can find a little comfort in sombre music as I hide and cry beneath a tower of pillows and blankets, but when the physical symptoms occur, it's fucking torture as there's no way out and you just want to die to escape the pain. 

It's been exactly a week today since I've been depressed and the physical symptoms seem to be lifting, but I'm still an emotional fuck who’s finding it a great struggle to be around people.",164,bshd5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bshd5o/does_anyone_else_suffer_terribly_from_the/,2019-05-24
902,Hello! I’ve kept my house clean for THREE months,"My whole adult life (The last 6 years) I’ve cycled through having a disastrous home and then a pretty clean one. It’s mostly 11 months of a house that looks like a legitimate hoarder lives there and then 1 month of looking like a normal person lives there. I wouldn’t let anybody into my place, wouldn’t take out the trash, wouldn’t touch my laundry. My brain didn’t care. 


But I just hit three months of a CLEAN FUCKING HOUSE! Even though my brain is still mopey and sad and distant I’ve managed to push through and pick up every day. 

I’m tired of being hard on myself. My brain has been really mean to me for a few years now and l don’t deserve it. It’s isolated me from my friends and family, it’s called me fat, made me binge on food, made me starve myself, told me I’m not funny, told me I have no personality, overanyzed everything everyone has said.

He didn't renew my sick note from work, he didn't increase my medication, I asked him for a dressing for my foot from a self harming injury yesterday and all he said was ""oh yeah that definitely needs looking at but I can't do it now"".  He was just so dry and unhelpful.

After, I stood outside the doctors and cried so much that 3 people came up and asked if I was okay.

906,Update on Status,"Hello All Again

&amp;#x200B;

Just wanted to swing in and give an update since my last post here. I got great news I finally found a good job a little over  a month ago. It started off as a part-time stocking job (its all i was about to handle at that time with how bad my  depression had got.) The job started off sluggish but with that being said I push myself (on the days that were the hardest for me) to get up and just do it, with out even knowing it I was getting into a grove where my days were getting better by just getting up and going into work. I was picking up more hours and staying late when covering shifts, I thought to myself finally I'm getting back to being a part of society again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last week my boss talked to me about wow I was adjusting and he saw great improvement in my attitude  ( He was aware of my depression when he hired me) And told me to put in for the full-time opening. Said with all the exp. I have in Retail that this opening would be a good fit. Well I just got the position......I'm now a Supervisor!!!!!  I haven't felt the good about myself or life in a very long time. (I've had the exp. but i just didn't have the mind set)

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short for everyone, Life does get better it just takes time and lots of work to get there, We will always have our ups and downs we just have to remember to keep pushing forward and we all will get top were we need to be...I've been pushing for 10 yrs now with this (depression all my life, but the worst hit 10 yrs ago and wasn't stopping) and little by little it got me here where I am now.",29,bsi2ie,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bsi2ie/update_on_status/,2019-05-24

912,Four months ago I posted a suicide note on Reddit and now I'm doing pretty damn great for the first time in my life,"I'm 18 and I've... honestly struggled with depression for as far as I can recall being alive. I know a lot of people feel like depression is the emotional equivalent of watching paint dry, or just constant numbness, but for me it was pure agony. Every second of my life was spent hopeless and wanting to die. Something else a lot of people say is that depression has its ups and down, and I don't remember having any ups at all; it was just a constant downward slope for me and I felt more and more hopeless by the day. I could not get out of bed. Some days it was so bad that I would scratch my thighs violently with my nails and lie on the pool of blood created on my mattress because I had the urge to hurt myself but I couldn't even be assed to get out of bed to get something sharp. If I were to rate it on a scale of one to ten, one being normal and ten being constantly being stabbed by burning knives in every inch of your body, I would give it an eleven. The only thing that kept me alive was my desire to pursue a career in astrophysics, but even that was slipping out of reach because studying was unthinkable for someone in my state. 

On January 7th of this year I decided I had enough and posted a suicide note on here, headed to the bathroom to try to drink bleach, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. Because minutes after I had locked myself in, 7 of my friends burst in through the front door asking my grandma where I was and if I was okay, because they had called several times in the past hour and I had not answered them. They had even brought me all of my favorite snacks. They put on my favorite movie from my childhood (Finding Nemo) and we watched it all cuddled up together on my bedroom floor eating the snacks while one of the girls braided my hair and tied it with a white ribbon that I still have. I wish I could say that this was the turning point, but sadly it wasn't. However their love made me feel so warm inside. It definitely made me think twice about attempting suicide again. 

It took me another month and a week until I gathered the balls to see a psychiatrist, which with my abusive family situation is the bravest fucking thing I have ever done. I ignored my mother screaming about how psychiatrists are evil and will try to lock her up in jail and I had my dad drive me to my first appointment and by God I will forever celebrate February 15th as the day I was given a second shot at life. I was scared to death but my psychiatrist is such a nice guy and I felt like talking to a best friend (he even showed me pictures of his cat, a black little fella called Pumpkin but he did not respond to that so they just called him Fufi). I was put on 50 mg of Zoloft, a brief prescription for Clonotril (a different brand name for Klonopin, so Clonazepam) for when I was having panic attacks or trouble sleeping, and a reference for a therapist. At first my mother tried to withhold my meds, then tried to convince me that I should take them at evening because that's when some doctor friend of hers said I should, and I did and I could not fucking sleep all night. I took Zoloft properly for the first time the next morning. 

It took three weeks to kick in. I only realized that it had when I found myself laughing myself to tears while my best friend tried to open a beer bottle with his belt buckle when we were in the middle of a cinema watching Battle Angel Alita. I don't think I had ever felt unadulterated joy before. It felt so fucking good dude, I can't even describe how fucking amazing it feels to spend your entire life in agony and suddenly you're HAPPY! And you never thought you would ever feel such an emotion! And with the help of my therapist I started making a lot of progress in a short time. Honestly, when I thought about the possibility of recovery I always imagined it would take me, like, at least a couple of years. I surprised myself by being able to get out of bed and go for a jog after only a month and a half. 

I would not say I am cured. I have a long, long way to go, but at least this time I'm walking and not crawling towards my destination, hell, I finally even have a destination. I feel like a proper human for the first time since I can remember and I can finally fully dedicate myself to my beloved astrophysics and get better at it. 

I used to spend my Saturday evenings crying myself to sleep. Now I go out with my wonderful friends and meet new people, play guitar on stages in front of crowds which I never even imagined I could do let alone have people come up to me after the show and tell me I kick ass at guitar, have dinner without wanting to throw up because I feel fat and disgusting, and if I stay in I spend my night drawing or writing music or studying. 

I used to be unable to fall asleep and when I did I would get the worst nightmares. My sleep isn't that good to be honest, but the quality has improved and I no longer sleep for 15 hours straight if not woken up. 

I used to have panic attacks when strangers talked to me. Now I have made so many new friends, and they all say that my sense of humor is great! I never even thought of myself as a funny person!

I am so fucking thankful to whatever deity is responsible for my road to recovery. I can't believe that I have hope. I am actually crying as I type this because feeling emotion is such a new thing for me and god fucking damn it, it feels amazing. I hope everyone gets to experience something like this because it's the best fucking thing ever.

914,My uncle died. He died pretty much alone.,"I should start out by stating I wasn’t super close with my uncle, but what he represents freaks me out and depresses me. My uncle died penniless, friendless, and loveless. All my life growing up he was a major alcoholic and part time drug abuser. He was very combative much of the time until he got cancer terminal cancer about 7ish years ago. That’s the only reason he stopped drinking because the chemo made him too weak. 

A couple weeks ago it metastasized to his brain. It was quickly downhill after that. He could no longer function. I’m not exaggerating when I say he looked exactly like a decrepit body you would see during war; like the Holocaust or the famine in Yemen. It’s weird having a family member look at you but essentially just be a skeleton. It’s hard to watch

Here’s the kicker though: not that many people cared when he was on his deathbed. Of the few of us that were there, it was mostly out of obligation since he was family. 

This event just has me thinking about my life choices because nobody who died alone ever thought they would die alone in reality; just like my uncle. Everyone who pushed everyone away and had life not go the way they planned never thought that would happen when they were young like me. I know I have a nasty streak to me and I know I can easily push people away. Sometimes I’m really fucking mean to the people closest to me that just want to help me. For example I had a long term girlfriend in college and I was have a really bad extended mental break down period, so right when I graduated I packed up my car and moved to a different city without telling her or anyone really. 

That was a pretty shitty thing. And I know the realistic answer is to work on myself and just not do shitty things like that anymore. And don’t get me wrong I’m working on myself. I believe I can change; I fear I won’t.

TL;DR my uncle died with no friends, no money, and no romantic life. I feel I have a lot of the same nasty tendencies as him and fear his life course could be similar to how mine turns out",42,bsjtxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bsjtxq/my_uncle_died_he_died_pretty_much_alone/,2019-05-24

Eating. Another bodily function. I recently went on vacation and had some amazing food, but guess what? It didn’t last, so what even was the point? I can only slightly remember the taste. This happens 3 times a day, I get so excited for food, and then it’s just gone. It’s like, I know that I just ate food, but it doesn’t feel like I did. So that didn’t last at all.

Video Games. I have an affinity for games of all kinds. Last night I played Fortnite with my friend and got a sniper headshot and it felt amazing, but what was the point? It didn’t make me better off. It was fun, but, while I know I played that game last night, it feels like I didn’t. It runs together.

Masturbation. Yes, I’ll get worked up over that hot titilating scene, and it will feel amazing, but what’s the point? I know that I did this yesterday, but I already don’t remember the feeling, or the video, so what was the point?

Social activities. I’ll hang out with a friend on the weekend, but a few days later, we have to meet up again and do the same things. What was the point of even doing it once?

TV. I’m rewatching Rick and Morty. I already watched the show, why am I again. What’s the point of watching a show, if I’m gonna forget most of it and have to watch again?

Vacation. Vacations are amazing times, but a week or two later, it’s just another hazy memory. What’s the point of going on a vacation if you’re going to misremember it a minute later. It feels no different in my mind than imagining you went. I could get the same effect watching a video about a vacation spot.

Even meaningful activities that improve you as a person don’t last. After finals week, I felt so accomplished and good. But now it doesn’t even feel like I have that accomplishment. I can’t enjoy the fruits of my labor.


My life feels so cyclical, I’m constantly filling a hole with fleeting pleasures, and they just never fucking last. My days weeks and months just run together for me. It’s all a blur. Nothing is real. Nothing lasts. Every fun and/or fulfilling activity just seems to have no logical destination. It’s all pointless meandering. It wouldn’t make a smidge of difference if I lived the best life, or just did nothing for a year.",22,bsn7jv,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bsn7jv/nothing_lasts_and_every_action_seems_pointless/,2019-05-24
927,Is it okay to take a day off from work if my depression has mentally and physically drained me?,"So in short I had a pretty nerve racking day and almost had a full on panic attack while at work. Im so exhausted right now and I feel like I deserve a break, but don’t want to feel guilty for calling in tomorrow.

Being apart from my S/O just automatically makes me extremely sad. We spend a lot of time together and we are best friends. She went on a camping trip for the weekend with her mom and sister. I’m not against her seeing her family and I’m definitely not gonna make her stay home. I just get so bummed out from working 12 hours shifts everyday and pumping all my money into bills, and when I come home to her she lights up my day and motivates me. Although lately my depression has been getting the best of me because we’ve been extremely broke due to issues with our car. So already being depressed about that on top of not being able to see her just drains me so much. I spent about an hour in bed bawling my eyes out just thinking about our situation and not getting her comfort. I can’t even bear to be in the house right now so I’m sitting in my car in the driveway. 

I realize I’m probably coming off as sound really obsessed with her, but again we are best friends who know each other so well and get along perfect that it’s hard to be without her, vice versa.",32,bsoiq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bsoiq7/is_it_okay_to_take_a_day_off_from_work_if_my/,2019-05-25

931,I was going to kill myself tonight,"I wrote a suicide note earlier in the morning. I spent most of the day doing things that used to make me happy: getting coffee, walking in the park, listening to music, etc. I ate my “last meal” while listening to Bob Marley. 

About an hour before I was going to kill myself, my friend from college messaged me and asked to play Xbox. We ended up reminiscing on good times, and laughing our asses off. It felt nice to feel like somebody cared about me. We’re planning on playing tomorrow too.

I don’t feel as bad as I did earlier today and I also am glad that I didn’t kill myself.",2859,bsrdr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bsrdr0/i_was_going_to_kill_myself_tonight/,2019-05-25

934,Depression after my son committed suicide,"My son took his own life just over a year ago. No warning,  no symptoms, no reasons. I texted with him hours before. He was in the navy and was coming home soon to go to the harley davidson mechanics program. It completely obliterated me. 

I am a father of six other children. 3 of them were adopted in (my son was one of them), the rest are biological to my wife and I. 

I've turned into the worst version of myself I could possibly imagine. I can barely get up to work. I can't sleep. A meal a day and maybe a snack here or there. I can't engage with people. I live in this weird place where everything is muted and I can't enjoy anything anymore. 

I've lost all my friends. I've lost any desire to keep up with people. I've closed all my social media accounts but reddit just to keep up with the world in general from time to time. 

I don't want to kill myself, but I can't help but feel completely worthless. Somewhere, somehow I failed as a father. I can see the looks in my kid's eyes. If big brother couldn't hack it, how will I? I'm not a big macho man, but I feel emasculated. Everything I poured into him for 12 years, every hug, every I love you, every heartbreak amounted to  not enough. 

I miss him terribly. Every day. All the time. The emptiness is consuming. We miss him terribly. My wife and I have grown so far apart. I have no patience anymore. I can't even stand to watch a TV show with them because I find it idiotic and a waste of time. 

I hate myself. I can't bring myself out of this funk. My antidepressants are a joke. My diabetes is wildly out of control because I just don't care anymore. I just want to sit and be but I can't. We have a suprise that is a year old now and there are no breaks. I play video games to try to escape, but it's always there. 

I would give anything to be able to breathe for a bit. It's soul crushing.",29,bsrudk,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bsrudk/depression_after_my_son_committed_suicide/,2019-05-25
935,What's the point in living if you're alone?,"My life revolves around going to work and coming back home to kill time until I go to sleep and wake up for work again. I have no friends irl or online or even anyone to talk to. I tried making some friends or just have any kind of conversations with others but it all ended the same way, people stopped talking or had ulterior motives and cut me off the moment they couldn't get what they wanted from me.

I don't understand how it's so normal for others to have so many friends and contacts that they feel like they need a moment to be alone. I wish I could enjoy being alone but I don't. 

I don't see the point in living to just work and sleep endlessly. What's the point if no one even knows you exist. What's the point if there's nothing in your life outside of work. What's the point in waiting for each day to end just to repeat the cycle the next day. What's the point if you're alone.",45,bss46d,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bss46d/whats_the_point_in_living_if_youre_alone/,2019-05-25

For all my teenage life the weekends have been laying on my bed scrolling youtube and occasionally wanting to die. In conclusion im a friendless borderline incell without the hate for women.",112,bssvgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bssvgv/i_wish_i_was_someones_favourite_person/,2019-05-25
